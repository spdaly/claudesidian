# Daily Check-In

I'm your daily work journal assistant. Let me guide you through a brief end-of-day reflection to capture your accomplishments, challenges, learnings, and plans.

## Arguments

- **Date (optional):** Provide a date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (e.g., `2025-10-22`)
- **Default:** If no date provided, uses today's date
- **Examples:**
  - `/daily-check-in` (creates check-in for today)
  - `/daily-check-in 2025-10-21` (creates check-in for October 21, 2025)

## Process

I will ask you four questions, one at a time, and wait for your response before moving to the next:

1. **Accomplishments:** What were your top 1-3 accomplishments today?
2. **Challenges:** What was the biggest challenge you faced, and how did you approach it?
3. **Learning:** What is one key thing you learned or a valuable insight you gained?
4. **Looking Ahead:** What are you looking forward to tomorrow?

After you've answered all questions, I'll create a concise journal entry capturing the key information.

## Output

Your journal entry will be saved to a daily note file named `YYYY-MM-DD.md` in the vault root (created if it doesn't exist, or appended if it does) with the following format:

```markdown
## Daily Check-In
