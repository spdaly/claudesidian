Application rationalization is an imperative; businesses can no longer tolerate an expensive, inflexible application portfolio. But it is impossible for application leaders to rationalize the application portfolio. The real problem is the business processes.

## Overview

---

### Key Challenges

- Businesses struggle with the challenges of a bloated application portfolio, which is both expensive to run, and slow and expensive to change.
- Individual project initiatives are incapable of addressing the broad, underlying structural problems of the current application portfolio.
- The focus on short-term tactical needs over long-term strategic portfolio planning makes the expensive and bloated application portfolio worse with every new IT investment.
- Many business management teams place responsibility for rationalizing the application portfolio on the shoulders of the IT management team, but the real need is for a business-led initiative to standardize and simplify the business processes.

## Introduction

---

Here are three common complaints from C-level executives when discussing their need for change in how IT works:

1. "We seem to spend too much of our IT budget simply running the existing systems, and not enough on delivering developments that will help the business grow and transform."
2. "At a time when the business is under immense pressure to move quickly to deliver on digital business strategies, improve business performance, reduce costs, introduce new products and services, improve customer service, and cope with demands of customers and regulators, our business applications are very slow to change and very expensive to change. IT applications are becoming the critical path inhibitor to business transformation."
3. "Every time we invest in a new application, we seem to create a substantial operating cost for operations, support and maintenance that was not correctly predicted in the business case."

There are two primary causes of these symptoms. The first cause is a bloated application portfolio with a high level of internal application complexity and architectural complexity. The second cause is the set of management and technical governance structures, processes and disciplines that have led to the creation of that bloated application portfolio.

Application rationalization is a multidisciplinary, multiyear program of work that will tackle both of these problems, and should be part of any continuous modernization effort. An application rationalization program must change the application portfolio so that it is leaner and fitter. It must also change the management and technical governance structures, processes and disciplines that led to the creation of the bloated portfolio in the first place.

## Analysis

### Reduce the Cost and Complexity of the Application Portfolio While Changing the IT and Business Investment Management Processes

The twin goals of an application rationalization program (see Figure 1) are:

- **For the application portfolio:** To manage the transition to an application portfolio that has measurably lower total cost of ownership than the current portfolio, while at the same time being more flexible and therefore faster and cheaper to change when change is needed.
- **For application governance:** To transform the way in which both business and IT stakeholders manage the application portfolio so as to ensure that the bloated and inflexible portfolio does not return.

These goals are not "nice to have" goals for any business — they are a real business imperative. No business can thrive with a bloated and crippled application portfolio.

The most common mistake in establishing an application rationalization program is to institute a goal of reducing the number of applications. Why is this a mistake? If your organization starts with 2,200 applications and is given a goal to reduce this to 750, a likely course of action is to tackle the problem by addressing the small and insignificant applications. But, looking at the real portfolio goals (described above) of reducing the total cost of ownership and improving agility, you run into a real problem if you focus your efforts on the small and insignificant applications. This is because there is a strong [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) in the application portfolio (see Figure 2): Much less than 20% of the application portfolio, by number, accounts for much more than 80% of the application budget. So small applications only account for 10% to 20% of the total application budget. However, if you spend time getting rid of small applications, it is almost inevitable that you transfer some of the workload into the large applications, meaning that the large applications become even more expensive and inflexible.

A useful way to communicate this analysis is using the metaphor of a zoo. Think of your application portfolio as a zoo. You have 2,200 animals in the zoo, but the zoo can't afford to remain at its current cost level. The problem is that the large animals in the zoo — the elephants and other big mammals — represent the bulk of the zoo's costs. The mice and gophers hardly feature in the cost accounts, and so reducing their number is immaterial to the ongoing costs of the zoo.

This advice — not to drive an application rationalization program using the goal of reducing the number of applications — puts some CIOs in a quandary. They understand the logic of Gartner's position that the number of applications is not just irrelevant, but actually counterproductive as a goal for their application rationalization initiative. But — and this is a big "but" — their CEO has explicitly provided a goal for the target number of applications. Following the logic of the "golden rule" (that is, "he who has the gold makes the rules"), the CIO must follow the directive of the CEO, and therefore, must reduce the number of applications to the mandated target. However, the CIO will know that following this goal is bad for the business, since it will not deliver on the real goals of an application rationalization program.

Under these circumstances, the application rationalization team should be split in two. A small team should be established to provide "numbers reduction" — to take care of the "mice" and "gophers" in the application portfolio, and to achieve the desired reduction in numbers. However, the main effort must always be directed at the "big game" in the application portfolio — the large, complex "elephant" applications that account for most of the budget. Even when dealing with the minor aspects of the portfolio, it is important to pursue the parallel "process" goal of application rationalization — to change the processes used to acquire small applications so that the portfolio does not simply bloat again.

It is important to note that with large, complex applications, you may well be able to achieve some success against the real portfolio goals (lower total cost of ownership and improved agility) without actually reducing the number of applications. This can be achieved through reducing the internal complexity of the applications by techniques such as removing customization.

### Change the Focus of Rationalization to Business Process Standardization

The first law of application rationalization states, "You have exactly the right number of applications today to run the business the way that you run the business today." Everything that you do in an application rationalization program is subject to this law.

The corollary of this law is this: "If you remove an application from the live portfolio, you must somehow be changing how the business works." These changes could be to process workflow, roles, responsibilities, or transparency and accountability. (There are a very small number of exceptions to this law caused by applications that have absolutely zero use in the business today. But these applications are unlikely to make a significant contribution to costs or to negatively impact flexibility.)

The fundamental question for an application rationalization program must be: "Do we have the authority to drive changes in business processes, workflows, roles, responsibilities, transparency and accountability?" For example, consider a telco that has five CRM systems. Can an IT-led application rationalization program drive the necessary level of business change to allow a substantial reduction in the costs of running these systems, while at the same time improving the agility of the resulting applications? The answer, in nearly all cases, is categorically "no" — the IT organization lacks the authority to drive the necessary level of business change.

An IT-led application rationalization program is almost certainly doomed to fail. Application rationalization is an impossible objective. It is also a business imperative. So, application rationalization really is an impossible imperative. But it is vital to understand this paradox, and to understand how it may be resolved. The resolution lies in changing the center of gravity of the application rationalization program, from IT applications to where it really needs to belong — the standardization and simplification of business processes.

Consider the hypothetical case above, where there are five CRM applications in one business. While these systems are all known as CRM systems, they are not identical. Each one has features not present in any of the others, and even where they apparently share features, the data structures, processes, workflows, roles and responsibilities are not the same. Imagine each of these five CRM applications is moved into a single application without process standardization and simplification. The resultant application would be so horribly sprawling and complex that it would be expensive to run, unreliable and almost impossible to change due to the high level of internal complexity.

It is therefore vital for an application rationalization program to adhere firmly to the mantra:

> No rationalization without process standardization.

Many years of research with Gartner clients across multiple industry domains and geographies have convinced us that meaningful application rationalization can only be achieved as a byproduct of a business-led business process standardization initiative.

It's important to note here that rationalization doesn't have to happen as a separate megaprogram. We have coined the phrase "continuous modernization" to address the concept of modernizing an application portfolio in chunks, and where it is a business imperative to do so. Rationalization can be done the same way. Where there's a business need to either reduce costs in a particular application domain, to improve business fit, to increase business value or to improve flexibility, rationalization efforts can be used in a targeted fashion.

### Gain the Active Engagement and Leadership of Business Executives

The critical question is: How do we procure business engagement? All too often, business managers perceive application rationalization to be a problem for the IT organization to address. They want the problems of the bloated application portfolio and inflexible applications to be addressed by some form of supply-side initiative — "Just make the problem go away." But the stark reality is that the IT organization can do very little to reduce the size and complexity of the application portfolio by itself: It needs the active partnership and leadership of business managers to engage in business process standardization and simplification in order to achieve the goals of the program.

Frequently, there is, in essence, a standoff between the IT organization and the rest of the business. Business managers seem to be saying, "We want lower application costs and more flexible applications, but we don't want to have to change what we do, or cede the right to define local processes that are different from the rest of the organization." But these two objectives, lower application costs and local processes, are largely mutually exclusive in traditional application architectures. If the business managers want the local autonomy to have their own local processes and associated applications, then the IT organization is faced with an impossible task. Effectively, all business managers believe that the whole organization has too many applications, but no individual manager is willing to sacrifice their autonomy and abandon their own miniportfolio.

In some organizations, the CIO may be in the fortunate position of working for an executive management team that has already committed to a major business transformation program. The business decision to undertake such a major operation may be driven by market conditions, mergers, acquisitions, divestments or any number of other reasons. Whatever the cause, the CIO should immediately link the application rationalization initiative to the business transformation initiative. The business transformation program will change the organization structure and define the business processes. These new processes will require application support, whether the processes are to be externalized (via business process outsourcing), run internally in a new shared-service center or run locally using a common process model implemented in a single application.

However, if the business is not currently engaged in a recognizable and funded business transformation initiative, the CIO aiming for application rationalization is faced with an obstacle — gaining time and commitment from business managers in order to deliver business process standardization. In these circumstances, it is necessary to be completely transparent about the level of duplication in the portfolio and the associated costs, in order to shock managers into engagement. Creating this transparency is a time-consuming task in most IT organizations. It shouldn't be hard, but it is. Basically, data from an application portfolio management (APM) discipline is needed to show not only how many applications you have, but also the level of functional duplication and the costs associated with each application. (For details about how to undertake such an activity, see "Taking on Application Portfolio Management's 'Wicked Problem' of Getting Business Engagement.")

It is important to target the right spot in the business with data about the dysfunctional, bloated application portfolio. Sharing data about applications is unlikely to cause any line-of-business manager to want to engage in business process standardization. Line-of-business managers are generally too busy pursuing short-term goals to be able to engage with programs where the value would not be delivered in the current measurement period. Application rationalization teams need to target the executive management team: the CEO/CFO/COO, who oversee all of the individual lines of business and would be capable of understanding the potential value of leading a business process standardization exercise.

Segmenting the current application portfolio can help focus business executives in the right place. As previously explained, it is a bad idea to drive application rationalization through pursuit of the goal of reducing the number of applications. It is an equally bad idea to migrate away from the current bloated application portfolio toward an application portfolio with an outmoded architectural style based on 20th century application architectures. Tomorrow's application portfolio is not yesterday's application portfolio on steroids. It is very clear that the large, monolithic applications inherited from the 20th century are incapable of delivering the low cost of ownership and flexibility that are sought as the outcome of an application rationalization exercise.

Application rationalization initiatives are dependent upon business process standardization and simplification, but that does not mean that there is no need for an application strategy. In fact, the level of activity engendered by an application rationalization program will result in chaos unless there is tight control over architecture and design, and unless initiatives are marshaled toward a set of strategic objectives for the portfolio.

To break out of the mold of inherited application architectures, Gartner has devised a tool called the Pace-Layered Application Strategy. This tool highlights that application capability needs to be delivered in three different layers: systems of record, systems of differentiation and systems of innovation. Twenty-first century application architectures apply different methodologies and tools to each of these layers, and provide the appropriate level of integration to allow seamless end-to-end business processes without the lumbering overhead of the monolithic application structure. For more details about pace layering, start with "What Is Gartner's Pace-Layered Application Strategy and Why Should You Use It?"

Another tool that can be used is Gartner's TIME process (see "How to Assess Your Current Application Portfolio Using Fitness and Value Review Processes"). This process places the application portfolio into tolerate, invest, migrate and eliminate quadrants. Applications to be rationalized will fall into the migrate or eliminate quadrants.

Build momentum for the rationalization effort by producing measurable business results, not by focusing on the low-hanging fruit of application numbers. Taken as a whole, application rationalization is a multiyear, multidisciplinary program of work that seeks to reduce the overall cost of the application portfolio, while at the same time improving its flexibility. Tackling 40 years of application management that has resulted in the current bloated portfolio will take time, determination and patience. Be wary of looking for "quick wins," which are attractive because they can give the impression of progress but have little substantive value. Scrambling to find lots of little applications to kill might look like activity, but it fails to address the challenging central problems associated with large, complex applications. If it is absolutely necessary to play the numbers game — to reduce the actual count of applications — then make sure that this stream of activity only consumes a small amount of management time. Focus the main effort where it deserves to be: on the large, expensive applications.

Application rationalization teams should be wary of making promises that they will not be able to deliver. Too many application rationalization programs lose drive early in the struggle because they fail to deliver short-term cost savings. While it is reasonable to have a long-term goal for the overall reduction in cost for the application budget, the actual achievement of any meaningful goal will take time, effort and investment. The team needs to develop an overall strategic approach to the challenges that they face, and then derive tactical initiatives that can be projectized and executed in pursuit of the strategy. Only then will the team be able to identify the committed savings in specific budget periods from the funded initiatives.

### Change the Investment Management and Application Governance Process

Application rationalization involves pursuing the twin goals of reducing the cost and complexity of the application portfolio while at the same time changing the investment management processes that led to the tangled mess of today's application portfolio. Changing the investment management process is not dependent on business managers taking the lead, as is the case with the business process standardization that leads to portfolio reduction. In changing the culture, processes and working practices of investment management, the application rationalization team will act as the catalyst for change across a wide range of roles spread between the IT organization and the rest of the business. For example, it will be necessary to address deficiencies in the business case templates and processes. These deficiencies include:

- Weak cost and benefit estimating
- Too little attention to detail in the lifetime total cost of ownership
- Technology selection ignoring existing investments
- Technology selection made before all requirements have been defined
- Insufficient focus on nonfunctional requirements

Changing these processes, and fundamentally changing the culture of application investment decision making, will require a high level of political and interpersonal skills since such changes will need to be negotiated with, and implemented by, many different stakeholder communities. The CIO, the senior IT management team and senior business managers must constantly demonstrate complete commitment to this goal of business process standardization; otherwise, the organization will quickly slide back into the comfortable habits of the past.

Application rationalization teams must take a hard look at the current application and product portfolio, and the projects and major backlog items in the approval pipeline, to establish the impact of these investments on the goals of the application rationalization program. If the current and proposed application projects will not make a net positive contribution to the goals of the application rationalization program, then they will simply create a bigger mess for the program to sort out. Such a policy leads to "one step forward, two steps backward" progress — in other words, no progress at all. Put bluntly, if the application rationalization program is incapable of modifying the investment governance process in order to favor project deliverables, which contribute to the rationalization program goals, then application leaders may as well shut up shop and go home.
