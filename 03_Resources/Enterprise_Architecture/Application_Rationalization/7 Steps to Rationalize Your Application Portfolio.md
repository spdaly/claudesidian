Applications leaders face increasing pressure to reduce the cost of their portfolios. This research outlines a seven-step approach to consolidate and decommission overlapping applications, contributing to an ongoing practice of maintaining application portfolio health and cost optimization.

## Overview

---

### Key Findings

- Too often, organizations have overlapping or duplicative applications within the same business unit, across business units or even across application instances or licenses.
- Application rationalization initiatives targeting the greatest reduction in cost, complexity and risk deliver more value than those aiming to eliminate a set number of applications.
- Some applications are more suitable for consolidation than others, and there are valid reasons for consolidating and not consolidating them.

## Introduction

---

> Application rationalization helps to reduce IT expenditure and optimize business processes and reporting. The focus is on the standardization of business process automation, rather than the number of applications in the portfolio.

Applications leaders are increasingly overwhelmed by the demands of supporting their application portfolio. According to the 2024 Gartner Enterprise Application Leaders — Signature Survey, lack of resources and/or budget is cited as the top hindrance to seven of the 10 primary objectives of enterprise applications organizations (see [Note 1](https://www.gartner.com/document-reader/document/?ref=solrAll&refval=501862016&#id.con76p7mvb4x)).<sup>1</sup> As a result, applications leaders are under pressure to reduce their portfolio costs.

Application rationalization can play a crucial role in this context. It involves standardizing common business capabilities and processes across the enterprise to ensure the application portfolio enables them in a unified way (or even in a limited number of ways). According to the 2024 Gartner Growth Agenda Survey, 47% of respondents cited standardizing and automating business processes as one of their top five initiatives to boost future profitability through 2025.<sup>2</sup>

Typically, application rationalization is achieved by consolidating similar applications due to functional overlaps, as described in this research. Occasionally, two other types of rationalization can take place:

- Retiring and potentially replacing applications due to poor business and technical fitness.
- Retiring and potentially replacing applications due to lack of strategic alignment.

However, these other types of rationalization are not within the scope of this research.

Application rationalization streamlines the application landscape by requiring multiple business units to use one common application for identical tasks, while also standardizing the use of these applications.Because rationalization enables business process efficiencies and operational cost saving s, it should not be considered as just an IT program. It must be part of a broader, business-led initiative to standardize business processes across the enterprise.

This research provides a seven-step process (see Figure 1) to help applications leader s rationalize their application portfolio and provides links to other Gartner research on many of the referenced subt opics.

### Step 1: Prepare

Executing an application rationalization program is not a complicated process. First, you will need to organize your team, get them grounded and establish best practices.

#### Assemble the Team

### Table 1: Application Rationalization Team Roles and Contributions

#### Educate the Team

##### Understand That the Business Must Sponsor and Fund Rationalizations

If application rationalization is considered to be an IT-only initiative, it will likely fail. This is because rationalization requires the business to undertake the task of migrating to a different application, which often requires changes in business processes as part of this transition. This is all work that IT cannot do alone. So, if IT proposes a rationalization project and the business is unwilling to commit to the necessary work and funding, the initiative will stall before it truly begins.

##### Select the Appropriate Application Categories

Avoid the misconception that the same method can be used to inventory and assess the many different types of software used by the organization. Instead, inventory and assess each application using the method best suited to their category.

##### Study Gartner’s TIME Model to Steer Application Portfolio Decision Making

A n effective method to inventory business applications is Gartner’s tolerate, invest, migrate and eliminate (TIME) methodology. This adds business capabilities and business fitness scores to the rationalization assessment, which are factors not required for nonbusiness applications. Adding the additional criteria means that, for business applications, your team will be assessing overlaps at the application, business capability and business unit level. See How to Assess the Fitness of Your Application Portfolio for more information on how to use the TIME model to identify rationalization opportunities.

### Table 2: TIME Reports and the Data Required to Produce Them

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1"><p><span><span><span>TIME data</span></span></span></p></td><td colspan="1"><p><span><span><span>TIME report</span></span></span></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p><span><span>Application usage by business unit (for each individual application or business capability)</span></span></p></td><td colspan="1"><p><span><span>Rationalization analysis grid</span></span></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p><span><span>Application fitness scores (including business, technical and </span><span>technical stack</span><span>)</span></span></p></td><td colspan="1"><p><span><span>TIME analysis (2x2 bubble chart)</span></span></p></td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"></td></tr></tbody></table>

Source: Gartner (April 2025)

Understanding application fitness will enable you to identify which, if any, of the overlapping applications qualifies as the preferred standardized application moving forward. Fitness scores can be gathered from IT and business stakeholders without requiring a collaborative effort, using tools such as surveys. However, if any of the business fitness scores are suspect, some joint IT and business sessions may be required.

Once this exercise is complete, you will have a list of potential rationalization projects to begin working on.

##### Review the Pace Layers Model

Gartner’s Pace-Layered Application Strategy provides a framework enabling IT to respond to differentiated business needs. The three categories, or layers, it defines are:

- Common
- Differentiating
- Innovating

When populating the TIME model, you will need to assign a target pace layer to each business capability, indicating how you should manage the business capability in the future. You may wish to prioritize any applications containing differentiating or innovating business capabilities, as the business may have a greater interest in sponsoring them.

See Use Pace Layers to Align Your Application Strategy With Your Business Strategy for more information on understanding how pace layers can help to identify and support the differences in business dynamics.

##### Consider How to Address Bias

When assessing the fitness of the existing application portfolio, business users may show bias for the applications they are currently using. This is especially true if the rationalization exercise is designed to reduce the number of overall applications.

To ensure comparisons are valid, find a way to expose the facts, as outlined in How to Address Bias When Evaluating Application Portfolios. Consider using a business analyst who is familiar with the domain to challenge business fitness scores that appear inconsistent with ground realities.

##### Understand When Consolidation Is Viable

You must acknowledge that application standardization cannot progress if the business does not wish to pursue it. Table 3 (found in [Step 4](https://www.gartner.com/document-reader/document/?ref=solrAll&refval=501862016&#id.riqgbs4h789d)) lists some factors that may indicate whether or not consolidation is viable.

See When Application Standardization Works, and When It Doesn’t for more information on identifying consolidation viability.

##### Learn About the Application Undertaker Role

Leaving old, potentially outdated or redundant applications in place results in a bloated portfolio. Appoint an application undertaker to guide decommissioning activities for such applications.

See Decommissioning Applications: The Role of the Application Undertaker for more information on how an application undertaker can help to define policies, procedures and services for decommissioning activities.

##### Think About Data Archiving

With guidance from the corporate legal team, your team’s enterprise architect should choose the appropriate data archiving approach and engage with the infrastructure and operations (I&O) team for each decommissioned application.

See Application Retirement Strategies to Reduce Cost and Technical Debt for more information on the importance of establishing consistent and routine strategies for efficient and effective application retirement.

#### Define the Program

##### Define Success

Rather than focusing on success being determined by a reduced number of applications, instead target:

- Reductions in cost
- Improvement of business capabilities
- Lowered complexity and risk

Ensure that your chosen measures document the initiative’s success. If the effort’s main goal is to save money, consider a cost-based metric, such as return on investment (ROI), and be clear about the money saved. If the goal is to enable the business to act more quickly, create measures documenting how much faster the business can operate.

If your mandate is to reduce the portfolio to a specified number of applications and this cannot be changed, consider setting up a second, separate team. While your primary team focuses on maximizing business value, the second team can be tasked with reducing t he number of applications.

##### Execute as Smaller Projects Within a Wider Program

Do not try to approach application rationalization as one big project. Instead, manage it as a program featuring a set of smaller achievable projects, each measured on its own.

#### Define the Project Scope

Ideally, rationalization is executed in cycles, involving three stages:

- Inventory a subset of applications
- Identify any rationalization opportunities
- Consolidate and decommission applications

Once each cycle is complete, repeat the process with a new subset. Executing the process this way ensures your team begins working on consolidation projects as soon as possible, instead of attempting to inventory and assess all or most applications at once and never accomplishing anything.

Consider the following criteria for defining inventory subsets:

- **The 80/20 rule:** Generally, more than 80% of application budgets account for less than 20% of the application portfolio. So, if your project is aiming to achieve a more impactful rationalization, focus on the highest cost applications. Conversely, if you are just beginning your rationalization efforts, you may choose to avoid these higher profile applications and instead select from the next tier of subsets.
- **Targeted business capabilities:** There may be applications causing known issues for specific business capabilities. For example, s ome applications may produce analytics data in a different way than others, causing inconsistencies. If such issues affect performance comparisons, these applications may be a good place to begin rationalization, as they will likely receive top-level support.
- **Suspected overlaps:** Applications that overlap considerably are most likely well-known to those familiar with the organization’s business applications. These could be the easiest to create a business case for rationalization.
- **Known sore spots:** Users relying on the less-capable of two overlapping business applications may be eager for standardization in favor of the more-capable product. This transition would gain instant business support and make rationalization more straightforward.

See Prioritize Business Domains for Application Rationalization for more information on how prioritizing business domains based on business fitness, need for business change, known problems and costs can divide rationalization work into more manageable efforts.

#### Define the Quality of Data

##### Ensure the Inclusion of Essential, Though Basic, Information

Make sure your inventory includes the relevant application, vendor and business unit details. Only add custom fields if they will provide immediate value. Otherwise, accept that your inventory will not contain every detail about every application.

##### Make the Data Maintainable

Store the collated information in a spreadsheet or application portfolio management tool, enabling the team to maintain it throughout the course of the project.

##### Improve Inventory Over Time

With each cycle, document the next subset of applications that you have the budget available to rationalize. Over time, your team’s application inventory will grow to represent all meaningful applications across the business.

### Step 2: Create an Applications Inventory

An applications inventory is the foundation of application portfolio management (APM). Plan to leverage the completed inventory outside of your rationalization program for other APM facets and benefits.

#### Inventory Nonbusiness Applications

Gartner recommends including the following nonbusiness application categories in your inventory:

- **Productivity software:** For example, email, word processing, spreadsheets and collaboration tools.
- **Science, technology, engineering and math** **(STEM) tools:** For example, computer-aided design (CAD) tools and lab software.
- **Data and analytics (D&A):** For example, d ata management, data analytics, machine learning (ML) and data governance tools.
- **Software infrastructure:** For example, t echnical stack components.
- **IT tools:** For example, a h elp desk, asset tracking, testing, DevOps and monitoring tools.

For more information on how to assess applications — as well as analytics, productivity, STEM and IT tools — differently, using methods suited to each, see Use the Right Portfolio Assessment Method for Each Type of Enterprise Software.

There are two potential options for building your inventory:

1. A spreadsheet — see Figure 2 for an example of the TIME toolkit’s application inventory spreadsheet tab, where basic attributes can be recorded.
2. An APM tool — a variety of commercial tools house application inventory records and provide APM features. See Market Guide for Application Portfolio Management Tools.

Figure 2: TIME Toolkit Application Inventory Records Example

Once the inventory has been built, record the application usage by business unit.

#### Inventory Business Applications and Capabilities

Use Toolkit: Application Portfolio Business and Technical Fitness Assessment to create an application rationalization analysis grid. C reate a row in the application inventory tab of the Excel workbook for each combination of application, business capability (domain) and business unit usage.

### Step 3: Assess Application Fitness

To assess application fitness, use your application classifications — both nonbusiness and business — from Step 2 to determine your approach. Nonbusiness applications do not necessitate the depth of analysis required when using a TIME-based assessment.

#### Nonbusiness Applications

Assess each application’s fitness using the assessment categories and methods outlined in Table 3.

### Table 3: Application Categories and Fitness Assessment Methods for Nonbusiness Applications

#### Business Applications and Capabilities

For business applications, continue the TIME analysis (initiated in Step 2) and s core the business fitness of each business application or capability.

Because your interest is rationalization and not application modernization, you can limit this scoring to business applications or capabilities with overlaps to save both time and effort.

See Toolkit: Application Portfolio Business and Technical Fitness Assessment for more information on how to systematically evaluate and manage application portfolios and communicate their fitness in application strategy discussions.

### Step 4: Propose Consolidation Candidates

It is essential to avoid forcing too much consolidation. Instead, strive to overcome natural resistance to change without impacting the parts of the business that are simply different.

Table 4 outlines a range of valid reasons for both consolidating and not consolidating applications.

#### Identify Application Overlaps

You may find overlaps within the same business unit, across multiple business units or across application instances/licenses. In this instance, develop a list of good candidates for consolidation projects by recalling:

- The reasons to either consolidate or not consolidate applications
- How to address bias
- When consolidation is viable

#### Choose a Standard Application

It is likely one of the overlapping applications will be chosen as the standard for the organization.

For business applications, strive to select the standard based on the business and technical fitness outlined in the TIME charts.

If none of the applications are suitable as the preferred application, identify and implement a new application to serve as the standard moving forward.

#### Consider Application Standardization

Application standardization is the full realization of the value of application rationalization. It uses common applications to standardize business processes and performance measures across the organization. This process goes beyond rationalizing the applications for cost reduction to standardize how those applications are used. Consider the value of application standardization for your organization, and identify whether it is a viable initiative.

#### Remap Business Processes

To accurately size consolidation project efforts, it is necessary to compare the required business processes and estimate the training and data migration involved. If the chosen standard application is new to the organization or to the business unit, it may require different business processes than the retiring application. This process difference will be a burden for the business, so obtaining business support (as well as funding) will be vital.

To help remap business processes, ask a business analyst and the business team to create a functional comparison of the:

- Business processes
- User interfaces
- Reports and analytics

#### Assess Other Application Dependencies

An application targeted for consolidation may be integrated with other applications. As a result, these integration points may have to be recreated. Identify any uses of the current data by other applications and include the estimated costs of recreating the integrations in your rationalization plan.

#### Discuss Reasons for Resistance to Change

This discussion will be based on your team’s knowledge of how well an overlapping application is liked and by whom. The purpose is to brainstorm how to best resolve any anticipated resistance to your consolidation project.

#### Identify Data Retention Requirements

Request that the corporate legal team defines the appropriate records retention, defensible deletion and access policies for the applications being consolidated.

#### Calculate the Benefits, Cost and ROI

### Step 5: Approve the Rationalization Plan

Approving the rationalization plan is where the challenging work begins. Other than the CIO and potentially the CFO, few will be concerned about the organization’s ability to reduce its expenditure by consolidating applications. Therefore, it is vital to have a strong business reason to justify the change. Reframe rationalization from being considered an IT-only initiative to instead being perceived as a business initiative by focusing on business process standardization benefits.

#### Establish Priority

Prioritize applications for rationalization that offer the greatest potential for reducing:

- Cost
- Complexity
- Risk

However, for your team’s first few projects, select opportunities that have a strong likelihood of technical success, business sponsorship and timely results. This will enable you to focus on the end-to-end mechanics of a consolidation project, in addition to building chemistry with the team and your business partners. Consider that applications with low business fitness will be more likely to win business sponsorship.

#### Create a Business Case

Establish the reasons for application rationalization:

- Position the business to innovate and change quickly
- Cut costs by reducing redundant software
- Reduce risk

Even if you have obtained an allocated budget for rationalization, a business case is still necessary because you will have to prioritize between different rationalization projects.

#### Win Business Sponsorship and Support

Remember that rationalization is not an IT-only initiative. For a consolidation project to succeed, your business partners must embrace it and communicate to their teams your need for support during the project.

#### Obtain Funding

Request project funding and advocate for the earliest practical scheduling. Highlight to senior leadership that they can spend to save or can continue to simply spend.

### Step 6: Rationalize

After following each of these key steps, you now have a consolidation project that is ready to execute. Just like any other application implementation, it is essential to:

- Stay in sync with the business
- Ensure strong training
- Transition to the surviving, standardized application

In the case of consolidation, there is also the additional step of decommissioning the overlapping applications — without which, the project is only partially successful.

#### Migrate to the Chosen Standardized Application

##### Communicate

Make sure to update the business sponsors and end users regarding what is coming, when it will be happening and why it is important to help ensure smooth adoption and support.

##### Train End Users

Provide end-user training, ensuring the training covers the functional differences in the remapped business processes.

##### Migrate Data

Understand the minimal level of data required in the new application — the rest can be archived and accessed separately. Map the data elements to the data import capabilities of the standard application and import the data, validating that the data migration is accurate and complete.

##### Migrate End Users

Treat the migration of end users as a “go live” event, just as with any new application. Ensure an extra level of support during the initial warranty period in anticipation of any issues or challenges that may arise.

#### Decommission

Assign the task of decommissioning applications to an application undertaker and ensure they:

- **Remove dependencies****:** The application undertaker must confirm that no person, business process or system is dependent on the application. Uncovering and understanding all dependencies can be challenging. Therefore, the application undertaker may use legacy understanding or discovery tools to identify static and dynamic dependencies, including data usage and integrations. The application undertaker must resolve any remaining dependencies or bear the outcomes.
- **Archive and retain data:** The application undertaker must convert legal data retention policies into IT policies and services, and accomplish the prescribed data archiving as an I&O project.
- **Terminate** **the application****:** Ensure the application undertaker completely decommissions all applications that have been replaced, with their dependencies removed and data archived and purged. If the application undertaker does not do this, the applications will continue to operate, which costs money.

See Decommissioning Applications: The Role of the Application Undertaker for more on this topic.

#### Publish Results

Update the expected results in your plan with the actual results and publish them. Use benefit-realization techniques to ensure the new processes are adopted and business benefits are achieved.

### Step 7: Celebrate

Take the time to increase your team’s chemistry by celebrating each application decommissioning. The scale of your celebration event can vary based on the value delivered, but make sure to mark the occasion somehow.

At the same time, call out special contributions with awards and discuss potential rationalization opportunities to consider for the next cycle.
