# Innovation Frameworks

## Overview

Modern enterprise innovation requires **hybrid frameworks** that combine structured governance with rapid experimentation. Organizations have evolved from traditional linear models to flexible, integrated approaches that adapt to project context.

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Stage-Gate Model

**Purpose**: Structured governance for managing innovation from ideation to launch

**Key Characteristics**:
- Sequential phases (stages) separated by decision points (gates)
- Go/No-Go decisions at each gate signed by senior management
- Risk management through progressive investment
- Clear deliverables required to pass each gate

**Traditional Stages**:
1. Discovery/Ideation
2. Scoping
3. Business Case Development
4. Development
5. Testing & Validation
6. Launch

**Modern Evolution**:
- **Lean Stage-Gate**: Simplified with fewer gates, faster cycles
- **Iterative Stage-Gate**: Allows loops back to earlier stages based on learning
- **Agile-Stage-Gate**: Integrates sprint-based development within stages

**Best For**: Large investments, regulated industries, hardware/physical products, high-risk initiatives

**Limitations**: Can slow down fast-moving digital initiatives; may create bureaucracy if implemented rigidly

### 2. Design Thinking

**Purpose**: Human-centered approach to innovation focused on deep customer understanding

**Deep Dive Resources**: For comprehensive understanding of Design Thinking, see [[Design Thinking Comes of Age]] (HBR on DT infusing corporate culture), [[Why Design Thinking Works]] (evidence for DT effectiveness), and [[What is Design Thinking? — updated 2025]] (current comprehensive overview).

**Key Phases**:
1. **Empathize**: Understand user needs, pain points, contexts
2. **Define**: Frame the problem based on user insights
3. **Ideate**: Generate wide range of creative solutions
4. **Prototype**: Create low-fidelity representations to test concepts
5. **Test**: Gather feedback, iterate, refine

**Key Principles**:
- Start with empathy for the user
- Embrace ambiguity and experimentation
- Bias toward action (prototype quickly)
- Fail fast and learn
- Iterative refinement

**Best For**: Front-end innovation (discovery phase), customer experience design, service innovation, addressing wicked problems

**Complementary Strength**: Excels at understanding **WHO** has the problem and **WHAT** solution might work

**Real-World Applications**:
- **Government/Complex Systems**: [[Innovation Case Studies#VA Center for Innovation]] shows how customer journey maps enabled organizational transformation in VA healthcare
- **Enterprise Scale**: [[Innovation Case Studies#GE Software]] demonstrates design thinking implementation at massive scale (GE's transformation from hardware to software)

### 3. Lean Startup

**Purpose**: Rapid validation of business models through experimentation and customer feedback

**Core Loop**: Build → Measure → Learn

**Key Concepts**:
- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: Smallest version that allows maximum validated learning with least effort
- **Validated Learning**: Use real customer data to test hypotheses
- **Pivot or Persevere**: Make strategic course corrections based on evidence
- **Innovation Accounting**: Metrics that measure progress toward product-market fit

**Key Deliverables**:
- Business Model Canvas
- Value Proposition Canvas
- MVP experiments
- Learning milestones

**Best For**: Back-end innovation (validation phase), new business models, digital products, startups and corporate ventures, high uncertainty contexts

**Complementary Strength**: Excels at validating **HOW** to build it and **DOES IT WORK** in market

---

### 4. Agile Development

**Purpose**: Iterative, incremental development with continuous feedback

**Key Practices**:
- Time-boxed sprints (1-4 weeks)
- Cross-functional teams
- Daily standups
- Sprint reviews and retrospectives
- Continuous integration and delivery

**Common Frameworks**:
- **Scrum**: Sprints, product backlog, sprint planning, retrospectives
- **Kanban**: Visual workflow, work-in-progress limits, continuous flow
- **SAFe**: Scaled Agile for enterprise contexts

**Best For**: Software development, iterative improvement, projects with evolving requirements

## Hybrid Models: Integration Strategies

Modern organizations combine frameworks to leverage complementary strengths. Research identifies **two integration patterns**:

**Strategic Context**: Design Thinking's integration into enterprise strategy reflects broader economic shifts. See [[Capitalism Needs Design Thinking]] for the economic rationale, and [[Design Thinking Comes of Age]] for how DT principles infuse corporate culture beyond product design.

### 1. Nested Hybridization

**Pattern**: Embed iterative methods **within** Stage-Gate stages

**Example**: Agile-Stage-Gate
- Use Agile sprints during Development stage
- Design Thinking workshops during Discovery stage
- Lean Startup experiments during Testing stage
- Stage-Gate provides governance, embedded methods provide execution approach

**Benefits**: Maintains governance structure while gaining speed and learning

---

### 2. Handed-Over Hybridization

**Pattern**: Use different frameworks **sequentially** as project progresses

**Example**: Design Thinking → Lean Startup → Agile
1. **Design Thinking** (Discovery): Understand customer needs, define problem
2. **Lean Startup** (Validation): Test business model, validate market fit
3. **Agile** (Development): Build product iteratively

**Benefits**: Match framework to phase, optimize for different types of uncertainty

---

## Framework Selection: Decision Dimensions

Choose frameworks based on four key dimensions:

### 1. Project Type
- **Incremental improvement**: Agile alone may suffice
- **New product development**: Stage-Gate with embedded Agile
- **New business model**: Design Thinking → Lean Startup sequence
- **Disruptive innovation**: Full hybrid approach

### 2. Market Maturity
- **Established market**: Lean Stage-Gate with customer validation
- **Emerging market**: Design Thinking + Lean Startup for exploration
- **Unknown market**: Heavy emphasis on experimentation and learning

### 3. Technology Uncertainty
- **Proven technology**: Streamlined Stage-Gate
- **New technology application**: Agile-Stage-Gate with technical sprints
- **Breakthrough technology**: Design Thinking + extensive prototyping

### 4. Learning Gap
- **Known customer needs**: Skip extensive discovery, focus on execution
- **Unknown needs**: Start with Design Thinking empathy work
- **Unknown viability**: Emphasize Lean Startup validation experiments

## Framework Comparison Matrix

| Framework | Primary Focus | Best Phase | Speed | Structure | Customer Input |
|-----------|--------------|------------|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **Stage-Gate** | Governance & risk | Full lifecycle | Slow | High | Moderate |
| **Design Thinking** | Customer empathy | Discovery | Fast | Low | Very High |
| **Lean Startup** | Validation | Testing/Launch | Fast | Low | High |
| **Agile** | Execution | Development | Fast | Medium | Continuous |
| **Hybrid Models** | End-to-end | Full lifecycle | Medium | Medium | Very High |

## Complementarity: Design Thinking + Lean Startup

**Research Finding**: Organizations achieve superior results by **simultaneously pursuing** Design Thinking and Lean Startup rather than choosing one.

**Why They Complement**:

| Aspect | Design Thinking | Lean Startup |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **Primary Question** | What should we build? (WHO/WHAT) | Does it work? How to build it? (HOW/VALIDATION) |
| **Uncertainty Type** | Customer needs, problem definition | Business model viability, market fit |
| **Primary Method** | Qualitative research, prototyping | Quantitative experiments, MVPs |
| **Innovation Phase** | Front-end (fuzzy front end) | Back-end (go-to-market) |
| **Output** | Deep customer insights, desirability | Validated business model, feasibility |

**Recommended Sequence**:
1. **Design Thinking** first → Deeply understand customer problem and desired solution
2. **Lean Startup** second → Validate that the solution works and can be monetized
3. **Agile** third → Build the product iteratively with continuous feedback

**Real-World Example**: See [[Innovation Case Studies#Alexion Pharmaceuticals]] for how the Discovery Program combines these frameworks in a 12-14 week structured process: Design-Test Loop (Design Thinking) → Experimentation (Lean Startup) → Evidence-based recommendations.

## Implementation Considerations

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Match framework to context** - No one-size-fits-all approach
2. **Build organizational capability** - Training and coaching required
3. **Adapt governance** - Tailor Stage-Gate rigor to project risk
4. **Maintain flexibility** - Hybrid models require customization
5. **Focus on principles** - Don't apply frameworks mechanically

### Common Pitfalls

- **Framework fundamentalism**: Rigidly following one approach regardless of context
- **Governance theater**: Stage-Gate reviews without real decision-making
- **Premature scaling**: Moving to Agile development before validating with Lean Startup
- **Skipping empathy**: Building MVPs without Design Thinking customer research
- **Analysis paralysis**: Excessive planning before experimentation
- **Conservative bias**: See [[Design Thinking Is Fundamentally Conservative and Preserves the Status Quo]] for critical perspective on DT limitations in challenging existing power structures

### Organizational Readiness

**For Stage-Gate**:
- Senior leadership buy-in for gate decisions
- Defined portfolio management process
- Resources for cross-functional teams

**For Design Thinking**:
- Access to customers for research
- Willingness to embrace ambiguity (see [[Use Design Thinking to Navigate Ambiguity]] for practical guidance)
- Prototyping capabilities and budget
- Understanding of how designers think (see [[How Good Designers Think]] for cognitive patterns)

**For Lean Startup**:
- Tolerance for failure and learning
- Metrics infrastructure for experiments
- Ability to pivot based on data

**For Agile**:
- Cross-functional team structures
- Product owner empowerment
- Technical practices (CI/CD, automated testing)

### Five-Stage Innovation Model (DVF Extended)
- **Framework**: Desirable → Feasible → Viable → Scalable → Adaptable
- **Origin**: IDEO's DVF framework (Desirable, Feasible, Viable) + practitioner extensions (Scalable, Adaptable)
- **Key Insight**: Works both as sequential stages AND concurrent evaluation lenses
- **Unique Contribution**: Makes technical validation (Feasible) explicit and adds continuous evolution (Adaptable) dimension
- **Best For**: Holistic innovation evaluation, portfolio communication, stage-gate enhancement
- **Integration**: Maps cleanly to DT (Desirable) → Lean (Viable) → Agile (Scalable) + adds Feasible and Adaptable
- **Detailed Framework**: See [[Five-Stage Innovation Model (Desirable-Feasible-Viable-Scalable-Adaptable)]] for complete guide

**Application by Innovation Type**:
- **Efficiency**: Feasible → Viable → Scalable (skip Desirable and Adaptable)
- **Sustaining**: Full five-stage progression (linear)
- **Transformative**: Full five-stage progression with iterative loops

**Recommended Use**: Adopt as concurrent evaluation lenses during Stage-Gate reviews to ensure comprehensive assessment across all dimensions.
