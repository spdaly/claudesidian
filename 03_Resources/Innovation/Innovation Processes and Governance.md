## Innovation Governance Framework

### Governance Principles

1. **Clear Decision Rights**: Defined authority at each stage gate
2. **Strategic Alignment**: Innovation portfolio aligned to corporate strategy
3. **Risk-Based Oversight**: Governance rigor matches investment and risk level
4. **Speed & Quality**: Balance thorough review with speed to market
5. **Transparency**: Visible criteria, metrics, and decision rationale
6. **Learning Culture**: Celebrate intelligent failures and validated learning

**Cultural Foundation**: Effective governance requires psychological safety. See [[Building an innovation culture]] for WD-40's approach: Culture = Values + Behavior Ã— Consistency. CEO Gary Ridge emphasizes that leadership must create the environment where people feel safe to explore.

## Portfolio Management

### Portfolio Types

**Three-Horizon Framework**:

**Horizon 1** (Core Business Innovation):
- Incremental improvements to existing products/services
- 70% of innovation investment
- Lower risk, shorter payback
- Examples: Feature enhancements, process improvements

**Horizon 2** (Adjacent Innovation):
- New markets, customer segments, or business models
- 20% of innovation investment
- Medium risk, medium timeframe
- Examples: Market expansion, new channels

**Horizon 3** (Transformational Innovation):
- Breakthrough innovations, new industries
- 10% of innovation investment
- High risk, long timeframe
- Examples: Disruptive technology, new business models

---

### Portfolio Balancing

**Dimensions to Balance**:

1. **Innovation Type**: Incremental vs. Radical
2. **Time Horizon**: Short-term (0-2 years) vs. Long-term (3+ years)
3. **Risk Profile**: Low vs. High risk
4. **Investment Size**: Small bets vs. Big bets
5. **Business Unit**: Across divisions/units
6. **Strategic Theme**: Coverage of priority areas

**Portfolio Review Questions**:
- Are we balancing short-term wins with long-term transformation?
- Do we have enough high-potential projects in Horizon 2/3?
- Are we over-invested in low-return incremental innovation?
- Does the portfolio align to strategic priorities?
- Are resources matched to highest-value opportunities?

---

### Resource Allocation

**Dedicated Innovation Resources**:
- Innovation team members (full-time or rotation programs)
- Innovation budget (separate from business-as-usual)
- Innovation spaces/labs
- Technology platforms and tools

**Stage-Based Funding**:
- Gate 1 approval: Small funding for concept development
- Gate 2 approval: Larger funding for MVP development
- Gate 3 approval: Pilot funding
- Gate 4 approval: Full launch investment

**Options-Based Approach**: Treat early-stage innovation as real options
- Small investments to keep options open
- Progressive commitment as uncertainty reduces
- Kill options that don't validate

---

## Process Customization

### Tailoring Governance Rigor

**High Governance** (Multi-gate, detailed reviews):
- Large capital investments (>$5M)
- Regulated industries
- High strategic risk
- Cross-business unit impact

**Medium Governance** (Streamlined gates):
- Medium investments ($500K - $5M)
- Moderate risk
- Single business unit
- Established market

**Low Governance** (Fast-track, delegated authority):
- Small investments (<$500K)
- Low risk
- Incremental innovation
- Rapid experimentation

---

### Agile Governance for Digital Innovation

**Differences from Traditional Stage-Gate**:
- **Continuous reviews** vs. discrete gates
- **Incremental funding** vs. full phase funding
- **Empowered teams** vs. centralized control
- **Learning metrics** vs. only financial metrics
- **Adaptive planning** vs. fixed plans

**Hybrid Approach**:
- Major gates for significant funding decisions (Gate 2, 4, 5)
- Sprint reviews for continuous validation (within stages)
- Delegated decision authority to innovation teams (within budget)
- Escalation path for strategic or high-risk decisions

---

## Common Governance Challenges

### Challenge 1: Gate Review Theater
**Problem**: Reviews become rubber stamps without real decision-making; "innovation theater"

**Solutions**:
- Clear must-meet and should-meet criteria
- Empower gate keepers to say "No"
- Require evidence-based decisions
- Kill projects that don't meet criteria
- Celebrate intelligent failures

**Warning Signs**: See [[The Corporate Innovation Ecosystem]] for common patterns of innovation theater - programs that sit at the edge of business without real power or impact. [[Innovation Case Studies#Alexion Pharmaceuticals]] shows how to ensure strategic backing instead of theater.

---

### Challenge 2: Analysis Paralysis
**Problem**: Excessive planning and documentation delays progress

**Solutions**:
- Right-size governance to risk level
- Emphasize learning over prediction
- Use rapid prototyping and MVPs
- Set time limits for gate preparation
- Focus on key decision factors

---

### Challenge 3: Resource Starvation
**Problem**: Innovation projects under-resourced or talent pulled back to BAU

**Solutions**:
- Ring-fence innovation budget
- Dedicated innovation team members
- Executive sponsorship to protect resources
- Clear resource commitments at gates
- Rotation programs for talent development

---

### Challenge 4: Siloed Innovation
**Problem**: Innovation happens in pockets without cross-functional collaboration

**Solutions**:
- Cross-functional innovation teams
- Central portfolio visibility
- Shared innovation platforms
- Knowledge sharing forums
- Incentives for collaboration

---

### Challenge 5: Misaligned Metrics
**Problem**: Metrics focus on activity (# of ideas) vs. value created

**Solutions**:
- Track outcome metrics (revenue, value created)
- Balance input, process, and output metrics
- Innovation accounting for early-stage projects
- Link metrics to strategic goals
- See: [[Innovation Metrics and KPIs]]
