- Insular, US-centric focus
- "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality
- Lack of innovation
- Leadership behavior was a blocker to innovation
- Low diversity

**Business Impact**: Limited global expansion, minimal product innovation

#### Transformation Approach

**1. The Culture Map Tool**
Alex Osterwalder introduced the Culture Map to help WD-40:
- Visualize current culture
- Define desired culture
- Identify enablers and blockers

**2. Defining Desired Outcome**
Not just "innovation culture" but specifically:
> "We exist to create positive lasting memories solving problems in factories, homes, and workshops around the world."

**3. Behavior-Based Change**
**Key Insight**: Culture is defined by observable behaviors, not words or slogans.
