# Five-Stage Innovation Model (Desirable → Feasible → Viable → Scalable → Adaptable)

**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Type**: Innovation Evaluation Framework
**Origin**: IDEO DVF Framework + Practitioner Extensions
**Related**: [[Innovation Frameworks]], [[Innovation Processes and Governance]]

## Overview

The five-stage innovation model is a practitioner synthesis framework that extends IDEO's validated **DVF framework** (Desirable, Feasible, Viable) with operational and evolutionary dimensions. It provides holistic coverage across customer, technical, business, operational, and evolutionary aspects of innovation.

**Core Insight**: The framework works both as **sequential stages** for planning innovation progression AND as **concurrent lenses** for evaluating innovation health at any point.

---

## Framework Components

### The DVF Foundation (IDEO)

The innovation "sweet spot" requires all three:

**1. Desirable (Human)**
- **Definition**: Customers want it, solves real pain or creates meaningful delight
- **Key Question**: Is there a compelling customer need?
- **Primary Method**: Design Thinking (empathy research, journey mapping, value proposition design)
- **Evidence Required**: Customer research, willingness-to-pay signals, emotional resonance
- **Framework Alignment**: Design Thinking primary output

**2. Feasible (Technical)**
- **Definition**: We can build it with available or accessible technology and resources
- **Key Question**: Can we build it with acceptable resources?
- **Primary Method**: Technical validation, prototyping, architecture design
- **Evidence Required**: Working proof-of-concept, acceptable resource requirements, no insurmountable barriers
- **Framework Alignment**: Technical validation (often implicit in Stage-Gate Phase 3-4, now explicit)

**3. Viable (Business)**
- **Definition**: Makes economic sense, sustainable business model
- **Key Question**: Does the business model work?
- **Primary Method**: Lean Startup (MVP testing, business model validation, unit economics)
- **Evidence Required**: Positive unit economics, product-market fit confirmed, repeatable sales motion
- **Framework Alignment**: Lean Startup primary output

### Extended Dimensions (Practitioner Additions)

**4. Scalable (Operational)**
- **Definition**: Can grow profitably without breaking operationally
- **Key Question**: Can we scale it profitably?
- **Primary Method**: Agile development, operational excellence, infrastructure planning
- **Evidence Required**: Unit economics maintain at scale, operational complexity manageable, infrastructure ready
- **Framework Alignment**: Agile/Operational Excellence (Stage-Gate Phase 5-6)

**5. Adaptable (Evolutionary)**
- **Definition**: Can evolve with changing markets, technology, and customer needs
- **Key Question**: Can it evolve continuously?
- **Primary Method**: Platform strategy, ecosystem development, continuous learning systems
- **Evidence Required**: Platform architecture enables iteration, ecosystem strategy in place, learning systems active
- **Framework Alignment**: **NEW dimension** - addresses continuous evolution missing from traditional Stage-Gate

---

## Two Ways to Use This Framework

### 1. As Sequential Stages (Innovation Progression)

```
Discovery → Technical → Business → Growth → Evolution
Desirable → Feasible → Viable → Scalable → Adaptable
```

**When to use**: Planning innovation journey, determining current phase, communicating portfolio maturity

**Example**: "Our new AI platform is in the Viable stage - we've validated customer demand (Desirable) and built working prototypes (Feasible), and now we're testing the business model with pilot customers."

### 2. As Concurrent Lenses (Continuous Evaluation)

At ANY innovation phase, simultaneously ask all five questions:
- ✓ Is it desirable? (Now? In future?)
- ✓ Is it feasible? (Now? In future?)
- ✓ Is it viable? (Now? In future?)
- ✓ Is it scalable? (Now? In future?)
- ✓ Is it adaptable? (Now? In future?)

**When to use**: Stage-Gate reviews, go/no-go decisions, pivot assessments, portfolio health checks

**Example**: At Gate 3 review, explicitly evaluate innovation across all five dimensions, even if it's only in Feasible stage - this surfaces future risks early.

## Integration with Established Frameworks

### Mapping to Stage-Gate + DT + Lean + Agile Hybrid

| Stage | Framework | Stage-Gate Phase | Key Question | Deliverable | Kill Criteria |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Desirable** | Design Thinking | Phase 1-2 (Discovery, Concept Development) | Is there a compelling customer need? | Customer journey maps, value propositions, empathy research | No evidence of customer pain or willingness to change |
| **Feasible** | Technical Validation | Phase 3-4 (Business Case, Development) | Can we build it with acceptable resources? | Technical prototypes, architecture plans, resource estimates | Technical barriers insurmountable or cost-prohibitive |
| **Viable** | Lean Startup | Phase 3-4 (Business Case, Validation) | Does the business model work? | Validated business model canvas, MVP test results, financial model | Cannot achieve acceptable margins or market size too small |
| **Scalable** | Agile + Operations | Phase 5-6 (Testing, Launch & Scale) | Can we grow it profitably? | Scalability plan, operational playbook, growth projections | Unit economics break at scale or operational complexity too high |
| **Adaptable** | Platform Strategy | Post-Launch Continuous | Can it evolve with market changes? | Platform roadmap, API strategy, continuous improvement metrics | Locked into obsolete technology or business model |

### Enhancement to DT → Lean → Agile Sequence

The recommended sequence in [[Innovation Frameworks]]: **Design Thinking** (WHO/WHAT) → **Lean Startup** (VALIDATION) → **Agile** (BUILD)

The five-stage model EXPANDS this:
1. **Design Thinking** → Validates DESIRABLE
2. **Technical Validation** → Validates FEASIBLE (often implicit, now explicit)
3. **Lean Startup** → Validates VIABLE
4. **Agile + Operations** → Achieves SCALABLE
5. **Platform Strategy** → Enables ADAPTABLE (NEW dimension)

**Key Enhancement**: Makes "Feasible" explicit and adds "Adaptable" for continuous evolution capability.

## Innovation Type Determines Required Stages

Using [[What type of innovation are you talking about?|three types of innovation]] (Efficiency, Sustaining, Transformative):

### Efficiency Innovation
**Definition**: Improves operations without changing business model
**Example**: Amazon warehouse robots

**Required Stages**:
- ❌ SKIP Desirable (internal optimization, no customer-facing need)
- ✅ Feasible (Can we implement this technology?)
- ✅ Viable (Does ROI justify investment?)
- ✅ Scalable (Can we roll out across all warehouses?)
- ❌ SKIP Adaptable (Point solution, not platform)

**Path**: Feasible → Viable → Scalable

---

### Sustaining Innovation
**Definition**: Builds on existing business model to strengthen it
**Example**: Amazon Kindle

**Required Stages**:
- ✅ Desirable (Do customers want e-books?)
- ✅ Feasible (Can we build e-reader hardware?)
- ✅ Viable (Will they pay enough for it?)
- ✅ Scalable (Can we reach mass market?)
- ✅ Adaptable (Can we evolve with reading habits?)

**Path**: Full five-stage progression (linear)

---

### Transformative Innovation
**Definition**: Creates new business models, often disruptive
**Example**: Amazon AWS

**Required Stages**:
- ✅ Desirable (Do developers want cloud infrastructure?)
- ✅ Feasible (Can we productize internal infrastructure?)
- ✅ Viable (Will enterprise customers pay for cloud?)
- ✅ Scalable (Can we handle global demand?)
- ✅ Adaptable (Can we evolve with cloud ecosystem?)

**Path**: Full five-stage progression + **MULTIPLE LOOPS BACK**

**Critical**: Transformative innovations iterate through stages multiple times as learning emerges. AWS validated "Desirable" with multiple customer segments over time.

---

## Decision Gates Between Stages

### Gate 1: Desirable → Feasible
**Question**: Is customer need compelling enough to justify technical investment?
**Evidence Required**: Customer research, willingness-to-pay signals, competitive gap
**Kill Criteria**: Weak customer demand, saturated market, marginal improvement only
**Healthy Kill Rate**: 50-70%

### Gate 2: Feasible → Viable
**Question**: Is technical solution viable enough to test business model?
**Evidence Required**: Working prototype, acceptable resource requirements, no insurmountable barriers
**Kill Criteria**: Technical dead-end, cost-prohibitive, timeline unacceptable
**Healthy Kill Rate**: 30-40%

### Gate 3: Viable → Scalable
**Question**: Is business model validated enough to scale?
**Evidence Required**: Positive unit economics, product-market fit confirmed, repeatable sales motion
**Kill Criteria**: Poor unit economics, can't achieve acceptable margins, market too small
**Healthy Kill Rate**: 30-50% (pivot or kill)

### Gate 4: Scalable → Adaptable
**Question**: Has scale been achieved to justify platform investment?
**Evidence Required**: Meaningful revenue/user base, operational excellence demonstrated, growth trajectory clear
**Kill Criteria**: Can't achieve sustainable scale, operational complexity unmanageable
**Healthy Kill Rate**: 10-20%

## Framework Strengths

1. **Holistic coverage**: Addresses customer, technical, business, operational, and evolutionary dimensions
2. **Flexibility**: Works as sequential stages OR concurrent lenses depending on context
3. **Integration-friendly**: Maps cleanly to Design Thinking, Lean Startup, Agile, Stage-Gate
4. **Innovation-type aware**: Different paths for Efficiency/Sustaining/Transformative innovations
5. **Platform-era relevant**: "Adaptable" stage addresses platform/ecosystem thinking missing from traditional models
6. **Communication tool**: Creates shared language for discussing innovation maturity across organization

---

## Framework Limitations & Gaps

### What's Missing

1. **No portfolio management**: Doesn't address how many innovations in each stage or 70/20/10 balance
2. **No governance structure**: Doesn't specify who makes stage progression decisions
3. **No metrics framework**: Lacks input/process/output metrics for measuring stage health
4. **No explicit kill criteria**: Decision points implied but not formalized (addressed above in Decision Gates)
5. **Linear bias**: Often presented as sequential, but transformative innovations require iterative loops
6. **No strategic theme guidance**: Doesn't connect to "Aspire & Choose" (McKinsey's critical elements)

### Recommended Enhancements

To make this framework enterprise-ready, ADD:

**1. Portfolio View**
Map innovations to 70/20/10 horizons:
- **H1 (Core)**: Often enter at Viable or Scalable stage (incremental improvements)
- **H2 (Adjacent)**: Typically start at Desirable, full progression
- **H3 (Transformative)**: Always start at Desirable, expect multiple loops

**2. Governance Overlay**
- **Gate Reviews**: Formal decision points between stages (Go/Pivot/Kill)
- **Stage Owners**: Clear accountability (Desirable = Product, Feasible = Engineering, Viable = Business, etc.)
- **Kill Metrics**: Healthy kill rates by stage (see Decision Gates above)

**3. Metrics Framework**
For each stage, track:
- **Input metrics**: Resources invested in this stage
- **Process metrics**: Cycle time, experiment velocity, learning rate
- **Output metrics**: Stage completion criteria met, validated hypotheses

**4. Strategic Alignment**
Filter innovations through strategic themes BEFORE entering Desirable stage:
- Only pursue innovations aligned to 3-5 strategic themes
- McKinsey: "Of eight essentials, **aspire** and **choose** merit particular attention"

## Enterprise Integration Recommendations

### For Existing Stage-Gate Organizations

**SHORT-TERM**: Use as **concurrent evaluation lenses** during Stage-Gate reviews
- At each gate, explicitly ask all five questions
- Don't replace existing governance, ADD these evaluation dimensions
- Example: "At Gate 2, we confirmed Desirable and Feasible, now validating Viable. However, we foresee Scalable challenges that need early attention."

**MEDIUM-TERM**: Integrate into **hybrid Stage-Gate framework**
- Map each Stage-Gate phase to primary stage focus (e.g., Phase 1-2 = Desirable, Phase 3 = Feasible + Viable, etc.)
- Make "Adaptable" stage explicit in post-launch continuous improvement planning
- Tailor stage requirements by innovation type (Efficiency/Sustaining/Transformative)

**LONG-TERM**: Adopt as **portfolio communication framework**
- "Our H2 portfolio has 12 innovations: 5 in Desirable stage, 4 in Feasible, 2 in Viable, 1 in Scalable"
- Creates shared language for discussing innovation maturity across business units
- Enables pipeline visualization and resource allocation decisions

## Key Takeaways

1. **It's real**: DVF framework (Desirable, Feasible, Viable) from IDEO is industry-standard; Scalable + Adaptable are valuable practitioner extensions
2. **It's flexible**: Works as sequential stages OR concurrent lenses depending on use case
3. **It's incomplete**: Needs portfolio management, governance, metrics, and strategic alignment overlays (addressed in this document)
4. **It's valuable**: Provides holistic coverage missing from any single framework (Design Thinking, Lean Startup, Agile alone)
5. **It's complementary**: Enhances existing frameworks rather than replacing them
6. **Best use**: Adopt as **evaluation lens framework** within existing Stage-Gate governance, ensuring every innovation explicitly addresses all five dimensions
