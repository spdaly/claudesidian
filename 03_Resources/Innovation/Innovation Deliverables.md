# Innovation Deliverables

## Overview

This document provides guidance on key deliverables produced throughout the innovation lifecycle, including templates, examples, and best practices. Each deliverable serves a specific purpose in validating ideas, building business cases, and driving decision-making.

## Core Deliverables by Innovation Stage

### Stage 1: Ideation & Discovery

#### 1. Problem Statement

**Purpose**: Clearly articulate the customer problem or opportunity

**Template**:
```
PROBLEM STATEMENT

Target Customer: [Who experiences this problem?]

Problem Description: [What is the problem or unmet need?]

Current Alternatives: [How do customers solve this today?]

Why Current Solutions Fail: [What's inadequate about existing approaches?]

Impact of Problem: [Why does this matter? Cost, time, frustration, risk?]

Success Criteria: [What would "problem solved" look like?]
```

**Best Practices**:
- Focus on the problem, not your solution
- Validate through customer interviews (minimum 10-15)
- Quantify impact where possible
- Avoid solution-centric framing

---

#### 2. Opportunity Brief

**Purpose**: One-page summary of innovation opportunity for initial screening

**Template**:
```
OPPORTUNITY BRIEF

Innovation Theme: [Strategic area this supports]

Opportunity Title: [Descriptive name]

Customer Problem: [One sentence problem statement]

Proposed Solution Concept: [High-level approach, 2-3 sentences]

Customer Segment: [Who would use this?]

Market Opportunity: [Rough size estimate if known]

Strategic Fit: [How does this align to corporate strategy?]

Key Assumptions: [Critical hypotheses to test]

Next Steps: [What's needed to move to concept phase?]

Submitted by: [Name, date]
```

---

### Stage 2: Concept Development

#### 3. Value Proposition Canvas

**Purpose**: Map customer jobs, pains, gains to product features and benefits

**Components**:

**Customer Profile** (right side):
- **Customer Jobs**: Tasks customers are trying to accomplish (functional, social, emotional)
- **Pains**: Risks, frustrations, obstacles customers experience
- **Gains**: Outcomes and benefits customers desire

**Value Map** (left side):
- **Products & Services**: What you offer
- **Pain Relievers**: How you alleviate customer pains
- **Gain Creators**: How you create customer gains

**Fit**: Achieved when pains/gains addressed match customer priorities

**Template**: Use Strategyzer's visual canvas format

**Example**:
```
Customer Job: Sales team needs to track customer interactions across channels

Pains:
- Data scattered across 5 different systems
- 2 hours/day spent on manual data entry
- Can't get unified view of customer
- Miss follow-up opportunities

Gains:
- Single source of truth for customer data
- Automated data capture
- Predictive insights on next best action
- More time for actual selling

Pain Relievers:
- Integrated CRM pulling from all systems
- AI-powered data entry automation
- Unified customer 360 dashboard

Gain Creators:
- ML-based next action recommendations
- Saved 1.5 hours/day per rep
- 20% increase in follow-up rate
```

---

#### 4. Concept Prototype

**Purpose**: Low-fidelity representation to test concept with customers

**Types**:
- **Paper Prototypes**: Hand-drawn screens, workflows
- **Wireframes**: Digital mockups (Figma, Sketch)
- **Storyboards**: Visual narrative of customer experience
- **3D Printed Models**: Physical product concepts
- **Explainer Videos**: Animated concept explanation

**Best Practices**:
- Start with lowest fidelity needed to test hypotheses
- Test with 5-10 customers minimum
- Focus on concept validation, not perfection
- Iterate based on feedback
- Document learnings, not just feedback

---

### Stage 3: Business Case Development

#### 5. Business Model Canvas

**Purpose**: Visual representation of how value is created, delivered, and captured

**Nine Building Blocks**:

1. **Customer Segments**: Who are we serving?
2. **Value Propositions**: What problems are we solving?
3. **Channels**: How do we reach customers?
4. **Customer Relationships**: What relationship does each segment expect?
5. **Revenue Streams**: How do we make money?
6. **Key Resources**: What assets are required?
7. **Key Activities**: What do we need to do?
8. **Key Partners**: Who are our partners/suppliers?
9. **Cost Structure**: What are the major costs?

**Template**: Use Strategyzer's one-page canvas format

**Usage**:
- Start with assumptions in each block
- Test riskiest assumptions first with MVP experiments
- Iterate canvas based on validated learning
- Use for pivot discussions (change one or more blocks)

MVP SCOPE DEFINITION

Core Value Hypothesis: [What's the #1 value we're testing?]

Target Customer Cohort: [Specific segment for MVP, size]

Must-Have Features (MVP):
1. [Feature 1 - why it's must-have]
2. [Feature 2 - why it's must-have]
3. [Feature 3 - why it's must-have]

Explicitly Out of Scope (Future):
- [Feature deferred to later]
- [Feature deferred to later]

Success Criteria:
- [Metric 1: target value]
- [Metric 2: target value]
- [Metric 3: target value]

Timeline: [Development duration]
Budget: [Development cost]
```

**MVP vs. Full Product**:
- MVP: Test **critical hypotheses** (does value prop resonate? will they pay? can we deliver?)
- Full Product: Serve **all segments** with **complete feature set**

**Example** (SaaS Product):
```
MVP: Single customer segment, core workflow only, manual onboarding
- Validates: Value proposition, willingness to pay, usage patterns
- Excludes: Multiple segments, advanced features, automated onboarding

Full Product: All segments, complete feature set, self-service onboarding
```

#### 8. MVP Experiment Canvas

**Purpose**: Structure experiments to test leap-of-faith assumptions

**Template**:
```
MVP EXPERIMENT CANVAS

Hypothesis: [What we believe to be true]

Experiment: [How we'll test it]

Success Metrics: [Specific, measurable criteria]

Minimum Success Threshold: [What counts as validated?]

Duration: [How long to run experiment]

Resources: [What's needed]

Risks: [What could invalidate results]

Results: [Actual outcomes - fill after experiment]

Learning: [What we learned]

Next Steps: [Persevere / Pivot / Kill]
```

**Example**:
```
Hypothesis: Sales reps will use our tool 3x/week if it saves them 30 min/day

Experiment: Deploy MVP to 20 sales reps for 4 weeks, track usage

Success Metrics:
- Weekly active users: â‰¥ 60% (12/20 reps)
- Average sessions per user per week: â‰¥ 3
- Time saved per session (survey): â‰¥ 25 min

Minimum Threshold: All three metrics must hit targets

Duration: 4 weeks

Results: [Fill after experiment]
- WAU: 75% (15/20) âœ“
- Avg sessions: 4.2/week âœ“
- Time saved: 28 min/session âœ“

Learning: Tool delivers value; reps want mobile version (not in MVP)

Next Step: PERSEVERE to pilot with mobile app added
```
