---

### 5. **Application Process - How to Access ECIF**

**Supporting sources:** Partner documentation, ECIF community discussions

**Key Insight:** ECIF is field-led (Microsoft AE drives), not partner-led. Customer/partner cannot self-nominate.

#### The ECIF Application Flow

**Step 1: Partner Identifies Opportunity (Weeks 1-2)**
- Partner working with customer on Microsoft solution
- Identifies need for funding support
- Determines strategic fit for ECIF

**Step 2: Engage Microsoft Account Executive (AE) (Week 2)**
- Partner contacts Microsoft AE for the account
- Discusses customer opportunity and ECIF potential
- AE evaluates against Microsoft priorities

**Step 3: Microsoft AE Submits ECIF Request (Week 3-4)**
- AE creates ECIF funding request in Microsoft systems
- Includes business case: customer, solution, Azure consumption potential
- Routes to appropriate approval authority

**Step 4: Microsoft Approves/Rejects (Week 4-6)**
- Microsoft field leadership reviews request
- Evaluates strategic alignment, ACR potential, competitive dynamics
- Determines funding amount (if approved)

**Step 5: Partner Executes Statement of Work (Week 6+)**
- Partner creates SoW detailing services to be delivered
- Customer signs SoW
- Work begins under ECIF funding

**Step 6: Microsoft Pays Partner (Post-Delivery)**
- Partner completes work per SoW
- Submits invoice to Microsoft (not customer)
- Microsoft pays partner directly for ECIF-funded portion

#### Critical Timeline Note

**Annual Budget Exhaustion:**
> "It will be important to move quickly and secure the funds because they historically run out in **May each year**!"

**Implication:** ECIF operates on Microsoft's fiscal year (July 1 - June 30). Funds allocated in July are typically exhausted by May, creating urgency for Q3/Q4 applications.

**Best Practice Timing:**
- **July-September:** Best window for ECIF applications (full budget available)
- **October-February:** Good window (budget still available)
- **March-May:** Limited availability (first-come, first-served)
- **June:** Minimal availability (new fiscal year budget not yet allocated)

### 7. **Connection to MACC (Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment)**

**Supporting sources:** Microsoft Learn, Azure documentation

**Key Insight:** ECIF and MACC are complementary programs that work together to accelerate Azure adoption.

#### What is MACC?

**Definition:**
> "Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC) is a contractual agreement where your organization commits to spending a specific amount on Azure over a defined period."

**How MACC Works:**
- Customer commits to $X in Azure consumption over Y years (typically 1-3 years)
- Commitment includes Azure services + eligible Marketplace purchases
- Discounts and benefits unlock based on commitment size

**Typical MACC Commitments:**
- **Tier 1:** $100K - $500K (entry level)
- **Tier 2:** $500K - $2M (mid-market)
- **Tier 3:** $2M - $10M (enterprise)
- **Tier 4:** $10M+ (strategic enterprise)

#### ECIF + MACC Strategy

**How They Work Together:**

**1. ECIF Funds the Journey, MACC Ensures the Destination**
- ECIF pays for migration/deployment services
- MACC commits customer to Azure consumption post-deployment
- Together, they de-risk customer adoption and lock in Microsoft revenue

**Example:**
- Customer wants to migrate 100 VMs from AWS to Azure
- ECIF: $75K funds migration services (assessment, planning, execution)
- MACC: $1M commitment ensures 3 years of Azure consumption
- Microsoft invests $75K to secure $1M long-term revenue (13:1 ROI)

**2. MACC Eligibility Drives ECIF Priority**
- Customers willing to sign MACC are more likely to receive ECIF
- Higher MACC commitments justify larger ECIF investments
- ECIF approval process often includes MACC discussion

**3. Co-Sell Incentives Amplify Both Programs**
- Partners who achieve Azure IP Co-Sell status get priority
- Co-sell deals can access BOTH ECIF (services funding) AND MACC (consumption discounts)
- Microsoft rewards partners who drive long-term Azure consumption

#### Strategic Consideration for Customers

**"Should we combine ECIF + MACC?"**

**Pros:**
- Higher likelihood of ECIF approval (demonstrates commitment)
- MACC unlocks additional discounts and benefits
- Partner gets co-sell incentives (may invest more in your success)

**Cons:**
- MACC locks you into Azure consumption commitment
- If migration fails or consumption lower than expected, you still owe commitment
- Reduces future negotiating leverage

**Best Practice:**
- Use ECIF-funded pilot/POC to validate Azure consumption projections
- Then sign MACC based on validated consumption patterns
- Don't commit to MACC before proving Azure works for your workloads

- ECIF-approved for enterprise-scale deployments
- Strong in complex migrations and transformations

**3. Specialized Solution Partners**
- Technology-specific partners (AI, security, data, modern work)
- Deep expertise in particular Microsoft solutions
- Examples: Trustwave (security), R3 (cloud), Elysian IT (collaboration)

**4. Microsoft Managed Partners (MMPs)**
- Tier-1 partners with deep Microsoft relationship
- Preferential access to ECIF funding
- Often have dedicated Microsoft PDM relationships

**5. Certified ISVs (for Contact Center, etc.)**
- Independent software vendors with certified solutions
- Example: Altigen (ECIF-certified for Teams contact center)
- Can receive ECIF to fund customer deployments of their solutions

#### How to Find ECIF-Approved Partners

**Challenge:** No public directory of ECIF-approved partners.

**Methods to Identify:**
1. **Ask Microsoft AE:** Your Microsoft account executive knows approved partners
2. **Partner Certifications:** Look for Solutions Partner designations
3. **Partner Marketing:** Partners often advertise ECIF approval status
4. **Microsoft Partner Finder:** Search for partners with relevant competencies

**Red Flags:**
- Partner claims they can "guarantee" ECIF approval (they can't - Microsoft decides)
- Partner has no relationship with your Microsoft AE
- Partner doesn't understand ECIF process or ACR requirements

---

## Contradictions/Tensions

### 1. **"Customer Need" vs. "Microsoft Strategic Value"**

**Contradiction:**
- Customers may have genuine need for funding support
- BUT Microsoft prioritizes projects that drive Microsoft's strategic goals

**Resolution:**
- Frame customer need in terms of Microsoft priorities
- "We need Teams contact center" → "We're displacing Cisco and committing to Microsoft ecosystem"

**Implication:**
- ECIF is not a general-purpose grant program
- It's a strategic investment program aligned with Microsoft's revenue goals

---

### 2. **"Partner-Led" vs. "Field-Led" Program**

### 6. **Create ECIF + MACC Package Offers**

**Why:** Combining ECIF (services) + MACC (consumption) strengthens Microsoft alignment.

**What to Do:**
- Develop packaged offerings that include ECIF-funded deployment + MACC commitment
- Create pricing models that assume ECIF funding (reduces customer cost)
- Build business cases showing total cost of ownership with ECIF + MACC discounts
- Train sales team on ECIF + MACC positioning

**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks

**Deliverable:** ECIF-Enabled Service Packages

**Example Package:**
**"Azure AI Virtual Assistant Accelerator with ECIF"**
- Total Project Cost: $450,000 (same as Seven Corners scope)
- Customer Investment: $375,000 (you cover 75K via other funding/margin)
- ECIF Funding: $75,000 (covers Phase 1 discovery and pilot)
- MACC Commitment: $750K over 3 years (Azure AI consumption)
- Net Customer Savings: $75K upfront + MACC discounts (estimated 10-15% = $75K-$112K)
- **Total Customer Benefit: $150K-$187K cost reduction**

**Competitive Advantage:**
Competitors without ECIF access cannot offer same value proposition.
