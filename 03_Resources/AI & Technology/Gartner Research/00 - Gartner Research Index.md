### 3. How to Decide Whether to Build, Buy or Blend Your AI Projects

**File**: [[How to Decide Whether to Build, Buy or Blend Your AI Projects]]
**Published**: 2025
**Type**: Decision framework

**Core Framework:**

| Use Case Type | Purpose | Value Currency |
|---------------|---------|----------------|
| **Defend** | Augment productivity, maintain parity | Return on employee |
| **Extend** | Transform processes, differentiate | Return on investment (ROI) |
| **Upend** | Disrupt with new value propositions | Return on the future |

**Decision Factors (9 key):**
1. External differentiation
2. Compliance
3. Security
4. Vendor ecosystem
5. Data
6. Skills
7. Short-term costs
8. Long-term costs
9. Time to market

**Defend Projects:**
- Decision: Embedded AI (incumbent vendor) vs. BYOAI (bring-your-own-AI)
- Key consideration: Convenience, integration, compliance

**Extend Projects:**
- Decision: Buy vs. Blend vs. Build
- Key consideration: Differentiation value, skills, data advantage

**Upend Projects:**
- Decision: Build (typically) or Blend (with strong vendor risk management)
- Key consideration: Strategic control, data uniqueness, vendor resilience

### 4. The AI Bubble That Wasn't: Misread Signals in the Era of Real Transformation

**File**: [[The AI Bubble That Wasn't Misread Signals in the Era of Real Transformation]]
**Published**: 2025
**Type**: Thought leadership / market analysis

**Key Arguments:**
- AI is in Trough of Disillusionment (Gartner Hype Cycle) but NOT in decline
- Disillusionment ≠ failure; it signals harder/slower adoption than hyped, not retreat
- CEO/CFO urgency remains elevated; AI is #1 growth and technology priority for 2025
- Principal barriers: poor data readiness, fragmented pilots, limited business engagement
- Behind the scenes: enterprise AI maturity is quietly increasing

**Strategic Implications:**
- Expectations stabilizing (realistic vs. hype)
- FOMO and executive urgency still driving investment
- AI will have most disruptive (shockwave-type) impact vs. any other technology

**Relevant To:**
- Client communication (managing expectations)
- Positioning AI advisory services during disillusionment phase
- Understanding market dynamics and investment cycles

## Cross-Cutting Insights

### Common Frameworks Across Articles

**Value Categorization:**
- **Return on employee** (defend): Individual productivity gains
- **Return on investment** (extend): Traditional ROI, process transformation
- **Return on the future** (upend): Strategic bets, new business models

**AI Maturity Progression:**
- Employee/process level (augmentation) → 90% of orgs
- Enterprise level (transformation) → <30% of orgs
- Industry/ecosystem level (disruption) → Early movers only

**Organizational Readiness Dimensions:**
1. Ability to drive change
2. Ability to manage risk
3. Ability to sense shifting conditions
4. Ability to sustain core operations amid disruption

### Key Statistics

- **2024 Gartner AI Survey findings:**
  - Majority of CIOs organizing 5+ AI projects
  - 29% pursuing 10+ AI projects
  - 90% employ GenAI only at employee/process level
  - <30% focus on enterprise-level initiatives that enable shockwaves

- **CEO/CFO priorities:**
  - AI is #1 growth and technology priority for 2025
  - AI expected to have most disruptive impact vs. any other technology

## Application to Consulting Practice

### For AI Strategy Engagements

**Discovery Phase:**
1. Use Shockwaves framework to assess client's industry exposure
2. Apply Toolkit diagnostic questions to identify vulnerabilities
3. Categorize proposed AI initiatives (Defend/Extend/Upend)
4. Assess organizational readiness across four dimensions

**Strategy Development:**
1. Define value currency for each initiative (employee/ROI/future)
2. Apply Build/Buy/Blend framework to sourcing decisions
3. Design AI Journey KPIs beyond use-case ROI
4. Plan for behavioral byproducts and skills development

**Change Management:**
1. Structure governance (Board → Transformation Team → Steering Groups)
2. Track leading indicators (readiness, experience, brand)
3. Facilitate CxO conversations on business model impact
4. Build grassroots communities for adoption

### For Power BI Fabric Migration

**Direct Applications:**
- Build/Buy/Blend framework for Copilot investment decision
