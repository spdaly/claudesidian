## When to Use

---

### Introduction

This toolkit, based on Gartner’s flagship research on AI shockwaves, equips CIOs and executive leaders to measure readiness for AI-driven disruption (see AI Shockwaves Are the Real Disruptors That Emerge in the Postproductivity Era). It highlights organizational strengths and vulnerabilities, providing a structured path to sharpen competitiveness, guide strategy, and build long-term resilience in an AI-driven future.

A central feature of this tool is the ability to test your industry’s AI-enabled competitive intensity against your enterprise’s preparedness to respond. This comparison reveals where advantages can be reinforced and where gaps must be closed to sustain performance and growth in a rapidly shifting market.

Each area of inquiry in this toolkit is grounded in Gartner insights that have identified early indicators of AI shockwaves already visible across industries. The toolkit then investigates these indicators within a particular enterprise, providing an evidence-based, real-time view of disruption dynamics. This approach creates a clear bridge from findings to action, linking foresight to the practical decisions required for execution, resilience, and competitive advantage.

### When to Use

The toolkit works best during critical moments in the enterprise strategic planning cycle. It can be a key part of annual or quarterly strategic reviews, helping CIOs and executive leaders foresee how AI-driven changes might disrupt established markets. Corporate strategy and innovation leaders, as well as general managers and product leaders, must be central to this effort to facilitate a strategic, customer-centric, and business-value-focused dialogue. This tool is also a practical companion when making significant capital or technology investments. This ensures that decisions are based on a clear understanding of both opportunities and risks. For example, a retailer noticing quick adoption of AI-powered buyer personalization tools by competitors could use the toolkit to determine whether — and where — to speed up its own AI plans or change its offerings. An industrial manufacturer looking into automation could engage with the toolkit to evaluate potential operational gains against competitive pressures in its industry.

Before you begin the full assessment, the following five executive-level “pulse check” questions offer a rapid glimpse into the critical themes explored by this toolkit. Answering them can quickly indicate whether the toolkit will uncover significant insights into AI-driven disruption specifically for your enterprise.

#### Five Questions for a CIO/Executive-Level Pulse Check

*To what extent would you agree with the following statements:*

- *Our organization leverages AI to capture and integrate comprehensive customer data from every interaction. This data is transformed into deep, real-time insights on behaviors and preferences, which continuously refine our strategy, offerings, and customer engagement.* ****Example: integrated AI data platform with behavior analytics.****
- *We have embedded predictive and autonomous capabilities into existing offerings, enabling proactive performance, optimization, and decision making.* ****Example: Predictive maintenance algorithms that anticipate equipment failures and trigger automated service actions.****
- *Our enterprise has established AI capabilities across the business, with multiple functions embedding AI into core workflows, a solid base of in-house expertise, and a steadily expanding portfolio of AI-enabled products and services.*
- *AI-driven competitors are rapidly copying our products and IP; creating synthetic data generation that mimics the characteristics of our real data; poaching our* *talent**, eroding once-secure advantages and accelerating disruption at a pace that undermines differentiation.* ****Faint signals include low-cost AI clones emerging; rivals using AI to undercut release cycles; generative models replicating proprietary features; ex-employees training competitor systems; early customer defections to AI-enabled alternatives.****

### Why Useful

The toolkit is valuable not least because it draws on evidence from across your enterprise, often surfacing surprising or contrarian insights, validating what is already sensed, or providing the momentum to overcome inertia and act on long-delayed priorities. A distinctive feature of this diagnostic is the inclusion of **“faint signals”** **—** some of the earliest observable indicators of disruption that can warn leaders before full shockwaves take hold. By making these signals visible, the toolkit helps transform abstract fears about AI disruption into clear, evidence-based insights, highlighting specific parts of the business model most at risk and pinpointing where competitive pressures are present and likely to intensify. The results will call attention to specific parts of the business model that are most at risk of disruption, and identify areas where competitive pressures are present and likely to intensify. By uncovering both latent threats and hidden enterprise strengths, it helps CIOs and leaders focus resources where they can be most useful. For instance, a financial services firm may discover that while its operational resilience is strong, its product innovation is falling behind competitors. This insight could lead to increased investment in AI-enabled product design, which impacts the value proposition. This level of initial clarity helps executives work together and speeds up decision making.

### The Three Components of This Toolkit

This toolkit contains a diagnostic exercise, which includes 30 global questions that generate the following three analyses. It should take participants 15 to 20 minutes to complete.

- **Disruption Vulnerability Map —** Provides a strategic visualization of the organization’s susceptibility to disruption, evaluating both transformational changes within its business model and the broader, AI-induced shifts reshaping the industry landscape (see Figure 1).

![AI shockwaves increase risk of disruption where both industry and business models are vulnerable. The map highlights zones of stability, flux and reorganization. Organizations facing dual vulnerability must prioritize rapid transformation.](https://www.gartner.com/resources/838700/838727/Figure_1_Disruption_Vulnerability_Map_Example.png)

- **Business Model Resilience Audit —** Delivers a comprehensive, component-by-component assessment of the enterprise’s business model, rigorously testing its agility, scalability, and capacity to evolve in response to accelerating AI-driven change (see Figure 2).

![Readiness scores show customer readiness is highest, followed by value proposition and business capability, with financial model lowest. Strengthening financial model readiness will improve overall business resilience.](https://www.gartner.com/resources/838700/838727/Figure_2_Business_Model_Resilience_Audit_Example.png)

- **Competitive Positioning Barometer —** Assesse s the organization’s business model readiness against the pace, scale, and direction of AI-enabled competitive forces in the market, identifying areas of strategic advantage and critical gaps requiring action (see Figure 3).

![Industry’s AI-driven competitive intensity scores 5.00, while customer insight readiness is 4.33, value proposition 4.22, business capability 4.00 and financial model 3.33. AI competition outpaces enterprise readiness in core areas.](https://www.gartner.com/resources/838700/838727/Figure_3_Competitive_Positioning_Barometer_Example.png)

### Using the Tool

Now it is time to complete the assessment itself. Open the AI Shockwaves Diagnostic Tool (Excel) and begin with the instructions on the first tab, “Tool Overview,” then continue through the tabs, following the instructions on each.

### What to Do After Completing the Diagnostic

The real value of this toolkit lies in the actions it inspires. Its findings should be summarized into a prioritized set of actions that address weaknesses and bolster enterprise strengths. This may include redesigning business models and operational processes, shifting investments to new capabilities, or forming partnerships to fill essential gaps. Results should also be integrated into ongoing management processes such as shaping innovation portfolios, guiding market-entry strategies, and influencing talent development. For example, a healthcare provider that detects high levels of AI-driven competition might respond by speeding up telehealth projects and retraining clinical teams in AI-supported workflows. To stay effective, the assessment should be repeated regularly, allowing the enterprise to adjust as technology and market conditions change.

The PowerPoint presentation included in this toolkit can be used to capture and communicate these findings and actions to your stakeholders.

In addition, Gartner can deliver tailored, challenge-specific guidance by combining actionable advice, illustrative case studies, relevant data trends, and forward-looking predictions for each area highlighted in this diagnostic. A companion sheet in the attached Excel Diagnostic provides direct links to published Gartner research aligned to the specific challenges identified.
