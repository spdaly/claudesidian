What if a core offering in your industry became free? Or obsolete? Beyond its immediate productivity-driven benefits, AI shockwaves — defined as the second and third-order impacts of AI innovations — will rewrite industry rules and create new business ecosystems. This analysis equips executives with strategic insight into AI disruption pathways and milestones, enabling timely and informed strategic response.

## Overview

---

### Key Findings

- The immediate, first-order gains of AI innovations include increased efficiency and productivity. However, executive leaders must plan for the larger secondary and tertiary impacts of AI, such as the obsolescence of products, emergence of new business models, and transformation of roles within an industry’s system.
- The earliest AI shockwaves in an industry may not ripple out of the walls of legacy institutions. The real momentum is building at the edges — especially in nimble startup-minded enterprises that thrive on speed, experimentation and daring ideas.
- According to the 2024 Gartner AI Survey, nearly 90% of technology leaders employ GenAI initiatives only at the employee or process level — for augmenting people productivity, or on an operational/workflow level. This tepid approach will result only in limited gains.
- According to the same survey, less than 30% of technology leaders currently focus on enterprise-level GenAI initiatives that can lead to industrywide disruptions. This is evidence that few leaders are tracking AI shockwaves to ensure long-term value creation and business continuity.

## Why This Matters

![A figure showing four circular graphs, with the graphs getting gradually larger from left to right. The circles represent the expanding impact of AI shockwaves across different levels. ](https://www.gartner.com/resources/830600/830666/Figure_1_The_Effects_of_PostProductivity_Era_AI_Shockwaves.png)

Figure 1: The Effects of Post-Productivity Era AI Shockwaves

> Productivity-led transformation is not AI’s real disruptive power. It’s the shockwaves that AI will cause when things become free, become obsolete, or when rules/roles are re-written in an industry.

AI shockwaves arise when the immediate gains of AI, like productivity, make way for additional shocks that propagate throughout an ecosystem — like the shocks created when new-found productivity forces an entire industry into a race to drastically reduce price or cost, or otherwise create and redefine value. It is these additional shockwaves, not the initial jolt of innovation, that are the true disruptors that force a change in competition, the economics of production, and the distribution and allocation of value.

The disruptive impacts of AI shockwaves are being driven by their broad business and operational deployments across enterprises, industries and society — not by speculative advancements such as edge AI or artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Und erstanding AI shockwaves is crucial for CIOs and executive leaders as it allows them to anticipate plausible scenarios within their industries, business models and ecosystems. This foresight is essential to move beyond immediate, first-order productivity gains and prepare for significant and long-lasting disruptions like obsolescence in a part of the value chain, the emergence of new services and value propositions, and fundamental transformation of industry roles.

Recognizin g the pathways of these fast-evolving shockwaves, as well as the challenges and opportunities they present, is vital for shaping enterprise strategy and the critical role AI will play in it. By visualizing and understanding these potential end-states and their respective impacts, organizations can detect AI shockwaves at the earliest signs and proactively engage critical internal and external stakeholders to adapt and formulate strategy.

#### Determine Your Readiness to Address Shockwaves

Executive leaders must assess two capabilities of their enterprises before making a plan to address shockwaves:

1. Enterprises must consider the **speed** with which they will pursue AI. On average, organizations are managing around 10 AI initiatives (s ee Enterprises Are Implementing AI, But Not Everywhere). This allows them to progress at an “AI-steady” pace — building talent, technology, data readiness, and governance gradually. In contrast, more aggressive adopters are running at an “AI-accelerated” pace, often managing far more than 10 initiatives. These organizations treat AI like a strategic portfolio, supported by high maturity in strategy, governance, and technology (s ee Pacing Yourself in the AI Races).
2. Enterprises must calibrate their AI response based on their **unique position** — whether vulnerable or advantaged — and align it with their enterprise strategic intent (see Toolkit: Aligning AI Ambition to Enterprise Strategy). Success hinges on readiness across four dimensions: the abilities to drive change, manage risk, sense shifting conditions and sustain core operations amid disruption. As AI reshapes business models and industries, organizations must evolve swiftly yet thoughtfully — balancing innovation with continuity, and speed with resilience (see How to Assess Your Readiness for the AI Disruption).

#### A Note on AI Disillusionment

It is true that the promise of immediate business value has stalled, and AI sits squarely in the Hype Cycle Trough of Disillusionment (see Tech FutureSight: Elusive Business Value Sends GenAI Into the Trough of Disillusionment). But will it hamper the oncoming AI shockwaves? No, the trough shouldn’t be mistaken for decline. Disillusionment arises not from failure but from the realization that AI adoption is harder — and slower — than early hype suggested. The principal reasons are poor data readiness, fragmented pilots, limited engagement from business leaders. Yet this stage signals progress, not retreat. Expectations are stabilizing, and behind the scenes, enterprise AI maturity is quietly increasing. Meanwhile, FOMO and executive urgency remains elevated: In 2025, CEOs and CFOs still rank AI as their top [growth and technology priority](https://www.gartner.com/mysearch/all?q=ceo%20priorities%202025), and that AI will have the most disruptive (shockwave-type) impact on their business than any other technology — by far.

## Analysis

---

At the same time, Gartner recognizes a fundamental disruption in AI-driven shockwaves that have the potential to transform industries and business ecosystems. The path of these developments remains uncertain because multiple forces shape their direction. And their effects will not follow a straight line.

### The Structured Chaos of AI Shockwaves

The benefits of AI innovations tend to spread well beyond the boundaries of the initial gains. Efficiencies achieved from targeted implementation trigger a disruptive chain reaction that can amplify, dampen, cancel out and ricochet off existing trends and patterns. In doing so, they can — *and do* — change the rules, upend the competition, force partners to adapt and prompt entire industries to change their operations.

The following examples, drawn from trusted sources, illustrate the disruptive power of shockwaves across a handful of industries, providing insight into the chaotic transformations that are already underway and are likely to persist. They are meant to inspire and illustrate the breadth of possibilities, not to serve as endorsements. While informative, they have not been independently vetted by Gartner.

- In the **retail** industry, Walmart implemented [AI to accelerate pricing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-walmart-is-overhauling-its-approach-to-ai-agents-4b1fbc65), inventory and supplier decision-making, providing the company with both cost advantages and improved responsiveness. That move, with its four AI “super agents,” elevated performance expectations for the entire retail industry. Walmart’s use of agentic AI marks a turning point; not in a race with Amazon, but in [the reinvention of retail itself](https://www.ainvest.com/news/walmart-ai-super-agents-strategic-edge-commerce-revolution-2507/) for a future beyond digital.
- In the **consumer goods** sector, Unilever applied AI technology to [enhance its demand forecasting capabilities](https://www.unilever.com/news/news-search/2025/how-ai-is-transforming-unilever-ice-creams-end-to-end-supply-chain/). The new system minimized product waste and improved product availability. This created ripple [effects in the consumer goods industry](https://www.cleverence.com/articles/business-blogs/how-procter-and-gamble-and-unilever-use-ai-for-smarter-manufacturing-and-supply-chains/) as traditional planning periods shrank, and real-time responsiveness became the standard.
- Maersk, a **shipping and logistics** giant, employed [AI to dynamically reroute freight,](https://www.maersk.com/insights/digitalisation/2024/01/03/how-can-generative-ai-drive-logistics-transformation) replacing traditional fixed shipping schedules with [data-driven flexible shipping flows](https://www.maersk.com/insights/digitalisation/2024/01/03/how-can-generative-ai-drive-logistics-transformation). The supply chain transition compelled ports, customs brokers, and inland carriers to digitize their operations to keep pace with faster-moving supply chains.
- Like some in the **pharma** industry, Pfizer applied AI technology to [shorten drug discovery](https://healthtechmagazine.net/article/2025/02/ai-in-drug-manufacturing-perfcon) from months to weeks, as essential strategic enablers.
- The web search industry has not stayed disruption-proof either. Generative AI tools now provide immediate answers to search, bypassing Google’s link-based system. Google’s “ AI Overviews ” are essentially the new intermediaries, displacing publishers from the business model, [reducing web traffic via clickthroughs by as much as 80%](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/24/ai-summaries-causing-devastating-drop-in-online-news-audiences-study-finds) while users stay on-page. A separate study by the Pew Research Center found that users only clicked a link under an AI Overview summary [once every 100 times](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/22/google-users-are-less-likely-to-click-on-links-when-an-ai-summary-appears-in-the-results/). This suggests a broader disruption at play, upending how information is accessed and valued.

Below, w e examine how shockwaves will transform business models and operating environments to help enterprises predict changes and adapt successfully in their evolving environment.

This analysis is structured into three distinct sections:

1. **Formation of AI shockwaves:** The first section  explains how technological innovations create a series of ripple effects or “shockwaves” that transform the business environment.
2. **Industry** **\-altering impact of AI shockwaves**: The [second section](https://www.gartner.com/document-reader/document/?tab=t.0) will focus specifically on how AI innovations are leading to macro-level changes extending beyond the organization into entire industries.
3. **Three pathways for action**: The [third section](https://www.gartner.com/document-reader/document/?tab=t.0) outlines the three actions organizations must consider to participate in the AI shockwaves that will manifest in and outside their industries

### Section 1: Technological Innovations as Precursors of Shockwaves

A technology shockwave begins with a breakthrough innovation that delivers the emerging first-order effects — such as time savings, lower labor costs, and improved employee productivity and satisfaction. T hese effects build upon each other to create a chain reaction that transforms business models and entire industries and affects broader societal and civic systems.

##### Wi-Fi 4: An Example of a Shockwave

The launch of Wi-Fi 4 in 2009 produced immediate first-order effects which included real-time data access and enhanced network services.That innovation accelerated the creation of business models like subscription-based TV and entertainment while hastening the demise of traditional TV business models. That further diminished the relevance of many other models, including news and print media and most brick and mortar outfits. Later, Wi-Fi 4, in combination with innovations like 4G and 5G, accelerated the creation of the video streaming industry and hastened the obsolescence of the DVD and Blu-Ray industry. Over the years, this shockwave has supported and amplified new digital ecosystems, including smart, connected cities among many other positive effects. In other cases, these shockwaves have had harmful impacts: cybercrimes, identity theft and digital inequities are among many challenges society faces today.Figure 1 gives a comprehensive view of the Wi-Fi 4 shockwave.

![A figure showing the shockwaves created by the introduction of Wi-Fi 4 technology in 2009. Adverse effects and positive creation are noted across industries and operational levels. ](https://www.gartner.com/resources/830600/830666/Figure_2_Shockwaves_An_Example__WiFi_4_Introduced_2009.png)

Figure 2: Shockwaves: An Example — “Wi-Fi 4” Introduced (2009)

### Section 2: AI Shockwaves and Their Industry-level Effects

An AI shockwave consists of the secondary and tertiary impacts of AI innovations that will shape future business environments by creating new value propositions, rewriting industry rules and roles, and catalyzing cross-industry collaborations.

#### Stages in an Industry-Level AI Shockwave

Gart ner classifies the development of industry-level AI shockwaves into four progressive stages:

##### 1\. Productivity Gains

**Defined:** Productivity gains are the first-order benefits of AI innovations. These gains manifest as increased individual and operational efficiencies, cost savings, enhanced decision making, and quality improvements across various industries. Gartner defi nes fou r productivity phenomena of GenAI:

- **Labor substitution:** A pre-GenAI phenomenon that increases productivity for all workers via tech substitution.
- **Experience compression:** The productivity of both low- and high-skilled workers undergoes a productivity boost.
- **Skill magnification:** Another phenomenon in which low- and high-skilled workers see a productivity boost. (Both experience compression and skill magnification are currently observed.)
- **Deep productivity:** AI/GenAI significantly enhances the productivity of an individual worker, such that the ratio of output to worker vastly surpasses current expectations (see Who Benefits Most From GenAI Productivity?).

**Examples:**

**Pharmaceutical Industry:** Sanofi has launched various AI programs to compress research time through predictive modeling improvements and automated repetitive task execution. This has enabled the company’s R&D teams to accelerate research processes from weeks to hours and improve target identification in therapeutic areas like immunology, oncology and neurology by 20-30% (see AI and Generative AI Case Study Snapshots).

**Software Industry:** AI tools are now widely accessible to software developers, significantly boosting their productivity. The Gartner Developer Experience Assessment Survey found that AI can drive productivity gains of 25% or greater for software engineering teams. According to another Gartner Survey of 487 CIOs and IT Leaders, over 40% of them expect to rely on GenAI more than any other solution to boost IT employee productivity in 2025. Gartner forecasts that by 2028, development teams using a comprehensive suite of AI-powered tools throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC) could achieve 25–30% productivity gains —compared to the 10% seen with code-generation-focused tools in 2024.

##### 2\. Market Shifts

**Defined:** Market shifts are the economic changes that come from the widespread use of AI in various industries. Markets will experience at least four principal shifts:

- Initially, automation lifts aggregate supply and alters demand dynamics. Enterprises will enjoy the early benefits of AI-driven cost savings and productivity improvements, though it’s unlikely that those benefits will translate into sustainable financial benefits.
- However, enterprises might choose to cash in the profit windfalls from labor augmentation or reduce prices to attract volume.
- AI systems will also enable new price optimization methods that respond to changing demand patterns.
- Finally, the labor market will also see changes: there will be a rise in demand and wages for high-skill jobs and a decrease in lower-skill ones.

**Examples:**

- **Enterprise IT Services:** Due to AI-driven productivity in software development and IT operations, many enterprises are reevaluating their spending and reconsidering their insourcing versus outsourcing strategies with IT service providers.
- **Increased Supply:** AI is enhancing aggregate output across industries by optimizing supply chains and enabling autonomous execution of time-intensive tasks through agentic AI.
- **Demand for AI Infrastructure:** The surge in AI productivity is prompting enterprises to invest heavily in data centers, AI models, skilled talent, and energy infrastructure.
- **Dynamic Pricing:** AI is reshaping cost structures via automation and augmentation, while also enabling [dynamic pricing strategies](https://fortune.com/2025/07/16/delta-moves-toward-eliminating-set-prices-in-favor-of-ai-that-determines-how-much-you-personally-will-pay-for-a-ticket/) that help businesses align prices more closely – and in real time – with market-clearing levels.
- **Labor and Wages:** AI creates high-paying roles in areas like model development, data science, business translation and implementation. Simultaneously, it is reducing demand — and wages — for lower-skilled jobs, leading to sectorwide labor shifts.

##### 3\. Competitive Changes

**Defined:** AI-driven competition refers to the race among organizations, industries, and even nations to develop, adopt and scale artificial intelligence technologies to gain strategic, operational or economic advantages. AI’s automation, optimization and predictive analytics capabilities are in the early stages of reshaping traditional business models and value chains by eliminating unnecessary steps, brokers and channels.This process of “disintermediation” expands profit pools and enables the rise of lean, AI-powered business models that can scale efficiently without proportional increases in cost. What sets AI-driven disruption apart from earlier waves of digital transformation is the unprecedented speed at which it unfolds. While it took years for companies like Amazon and Uber to disintermediate their respective industries, AI can now drive similar shifts in a fraction of the time. This acceleration not only enhances a company’s relevance within its own sector but also opens doors to adjacent markets.

**Example:** Early adopters of AI stand to gain significant first-mover advantages — discouraging competition and potentially creating winner-take-all dynamics. The commercial success of DALL·E demonstrates how new market participants can rapidly gain market dominance through innovative features that established companies tend to ignore. Adobe faces a traditional “innovator’s dilemma” because it needs to serve its professional user base while addressing the creative innovations that DALL·E now offers the broader market. This strategic tension forces incumbents to confront critical decisions — whether to compete, partner or pursue a hybrid approach.

##### 4\. Industry Shocks

**Defined:** Industry shocks from AI describe the profound and fast-paced changes artificial intelligence delivers to basic industry operations (see Figure 4 below). The deep-seated changes AI offers will disrupt established business models while damaging traditional value propositions and pushing previously distinct sectors toward convergence of value propositions. As such, AI innovation enables new participants to accelerate market entry through cost advantages facilitated by automation of complex tasks and enhanced decision-making capabilities, all of which tend to reduce entry barriers that transform industry incumbents**.**High-credential professions and entire industries face mounting pressure as AI delivers faster, cheaper and more scalable alternatives. Simultaneously, AI fosters cross-industry ecosystems — blurring boundaries between fields like finance and healthcare or education and software, reshaping competitive landscapes, and catalyzing the birth of entirely new markets. These shifts are not merely technological — they are structural, strategic and systemic.

**Examples**

- **Eroding value propositions in jobs and industries:** AI is making some high-credential jobs and roles — such as lawyers, software engineers and architects — susceptible to automation-induced disruption. But they’re not, of course, facing obsolescence outright; instead, their value propositions are being diluted as AI takes over core functions, making their traditional contributions less distinctive. Similarly, industries like call centers and tax preparation are seeing their business models challenged as AI-driven solutions offer faster, more efficient and more accurate alternatives that are also cost-effective.
- **Cross-industry ecosystems:** AI enables organizations to participate in hybrid ecosystems (e.g., finance and healthcare, sports and entertainment, education and AI software), facilitating data sharing and capability integration. This accelerates disruption, redraws industry boundaries and fosters the rise of new sectors.
- **Software industry disruption**: A growing number of enterprises are questioning the need to purchase software when generative AI can now write code with increasing accuracy and speed. Both [Microsoft and Google CEOs have stated that GenAI is responsible for about 30% of their code output](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/29/satya-nadella-says-as-much-as-30percent-of-microsoft-code-is-written-by-ai.html). This raises critical questions about ownership and control: Is the code being written by software vendors, system integrators, or the enterprises’ own developers?

![A figure showing how AI effects begin with productivity gains before shockwaves cause market shifts, competitive changes and, finally, industry disruption. ](https://www.gartner.com/resources/830600/830666/Figure_3_AI_Shockwaves_Are_the_Real_Disruptors_That_Follow_Productivity_Gains.png)

Figure 3: AI Shockwaves Are the Real Disruptors That Follow Productivity Gains

### Section 3: How Should Enterprises Engage With AI Shockwaves?

Enterprises have two principal choices regarding AI shockwaves: They can either opt to benefit from the immediate advantages of AI (cashing in on the first-order benefits) or they can pursue — *or participate in* — the transformative aspects of AI shockwaves.

Though hard to quantify financially, the first-order benefits from AI innovations can lead to significant productivity and efficiency benefits. But those gains can be short-lived, and tend to encounter value leakages at each level of the value chain, leading to diminishing returns over time. For example, in the legal services industry, GenAI makes legal research exponentially faster and cheaper, and machine learning algorithms can now detect trends in case law and forecast results based on empirical analysis. Law firms can choose to cash-in — *or internalize the gains* — of this first-order AI benefit by continuing to charge their clients based on the traditional billable-hour model. Doing so improves their odds of capturing margin improvements in the short-run, but they will also have to contend with the dwindling downstream benefits from two vectors. F irst, market forces will drive fees and pricing downward, competing away any excess profit in the industry. Meanwhile, clients will increasingly demand gain-sharing – insisting that they benefit from the AI-driven efficiency gains (for instance, through lower costs or value-based fees).

However, more substantial, longer-term value lies in the secondary and tertiary effects of AI innovations that create enterprisewide and industry-level disruptions or AI shockwaves. In the legal services industry, a law firm can leverage faster, more cost-effective GenAI-powered research to fundamentally rethink its fee structure (lowering fees while slashing its own costs and boosting quality) — potentially disrupting the traditional business model and triggering an AI shockwave that delivers long-term value to all stakeholders, including the industry itself. In this evolving landscape, the legal practitioner of the future will likely be as proficient in AI as in law, with AI seamlessly integrated into every stage of their workflow, from research to argumentation. Flat-fees, subscription-, contingency- and outcome-based legal business models could all fall into this AI shockwave category.

> According to the 2024 Gartner AI Survey, only less than 30% of CIOs and technology leaders are focusing on game-changing AI use cases that result in new streams of revenue or enterprise value proposition redesign. This implies that only a minority of leaders are choosing to pursue enterprise-level AI initiatives as gateways to AI shockwaves.

#### AI Shockwaves Are Inevitable

Disruptive AI shockwaves are inevitable — just as the transformative impacts of Wi-Fi, cloud computing and mobile technology once reshaped entire industries. These shockwaves can be instigated by any market actor that decides to apply AI in game-changing ways, with actors ranging from competitors and partners to customers, consumers and governments. Enterprises need to identify the handful of shockwaves that are unfolding in their sectors, assess their implications and craft adaptive strategies for staying relevant in a rapidly evolving AI landscape.

#### Three Types of AI Shockwaves

Organizations can think of the different ways in which they can participate in the emergence of AI shockwaves in or outside their industries. At the enterprise level, Gartner expects the AI shockwaves to manifest in three progressive ways, with increasing levels of difficulty and disruption:

1. AI Shockwaves That Lead to Innovation of New Products, Services and Value Propositions

The creation of new products, service and value propositions are some of the initial shockwaves of AI capabilities and the world is already experiencing them. The education industry, for example, is ripe for disruption by AI. A key product/service in the education industry is the service of tutoring students. But could AI become a tutor? Not only has [Khanmigo](https://www.khanmigo.ai/) offered an AI tutor for students, but it also now offers an AI assistant that helps teachers prepare for their classes by helping them efficiently develop lesson plans. For many, these kinds of AI applications are expected. However, the real shockwave is that the AI for teachers is free, and the cost of the AI for tutored students is only $4 a month. Both the product/service in the education industry, as well as the value proposition (i.e., free) have now been permanently disrupted by AI.

Envision the possible shockwaves in your industry. Consider the potential for:

- Increased demand for a product or service because it has become cheaper, easier to consume, and more efficient to deliver due to the use of AI.
- Extremely cheap or free services due to the automation of tasks, processes and entire value chains with the help of AI
- New categories of products or services as a result of faster and more efficient innovation cycles spurred by AI’s simulation and optimization benefits.

#### Example: Creation of new services with AI

![](https://www.gartner.com/resources/830600/830666/Case_in_Point__Image_with_Wrap_Feature_Callout.png)

Tempus is a company that leverages AI to analyze genetic information and patient data to provide personalized treatment plans, creating a new category of personalized healthcare services. Find out more about them from their [website](https://www.tempus.com/).

1. AI Shockwaves That Rewrite the Rules and Roles in the Industry:

What is the role of a physical hospital in the future when AI can diagnose (see case in point) and monitor the recovery of a patient at home? Certainly, a healthcare provider will provide diagnosis, treatment and post-treatment recovery services. But in an AI world, they don’t all need to be done in the same building or campus. Can AI not free-up hospital beds occupied by recovering patients and appointments taken up by diagnosis, leaving more capacity for treatment? AI will only apply to a subset of healthcare situations, but for that subset, will a healthcare provider rewrite the role of a traditional, physical hospital?

What about services providers in marketing and IT? If AI can create marketing content and provide IT services at a fraction of the effort/cost, should enterprises not think about insourcing these back into their operations? After all, the employees that will have been freed up by productivity gains can take these tasks back — especially the creative ones like creating marketing copy and coding in IT.

AI has the potential to create shockwaves to value chains, supply chains and partner relationships. Reintermediation and disintermediation are concepts that have been given new angles with AI. For example, if an AI agent can go all over the internet and purchase goods/services straight from the OEMs/brands, why does one need an aggregator platform like a travel site or an e-commerce marketplace? The AI agent will create this aggregation and create a virtual shopping cart/travel itinerary. Use these examples as thought starters to gain foresight:

Envision the possible shockwaves in your business model. For example, consider the potential for:

- Improved integration across different parts of the value chain due to AI.
- The obsolescence of many functions traditionally handled by intermediaries (e.g., customer service) due to automation by AI-powered platforms.
- Companies that now get empowered to respond to market dynamics and pivot proactively into new industry roles with the help of AI’s prediction capability.
- Lower capital and investment requirements across industries, attracting new industry players.

#### Example: AI leading to roles changes in an industry

![](https://www.gartner.com/resources/830600/830666/Case_in_Point__Image_with_Wrap_Feature_Callout1.png)

Children’s National Hospital has developed an AI system that can detect rheumatic heart disease [without the need of a cardiologist](https://healthmanagement.org/c/digital-transformation/news/ai-system-matches-cardiologists-in-detecting-rheumatic-heart-disease). The institute hopes that this will allow healthcare workers without specialized medical degrees to detect the disease. The ability for nonspecialized medical professionals to diagnose medical conditions with the help of AI has the potential to radically rewrite roles within the medical industry and lead to a structural change. For more information on Children’s National Hospital’s AI innovation, see [Novel AI platform matches cardiologists in detecting rheumatic heart disease](https://innovationdistrict.childrensnational.org/novel-ai-platform-detects-rheumatic-heart-disease/).

1. AI Shockwaves That Amplify Industry Ecosystems:

We’ve had discussions with medical associations at the very beginning of their AI journey. Their first AI strategy was to lock down their data to make it safe in an AI world. Their subsequent strategy questioned that thinking. For example, a medical association with lots of data could contemplate sharing that data back with its broader ecosystem. Wouldn’t everyone in the healthcare ecosystem benefit from pooling data so that research can be advanced for the collective? Isn’t that the fundamental mandate for a medical association — to advance the well-being of all in society?

AI plays two roles in this. The first is an obvious one: the more data AI has, the better it can advance research resulting in better health outcomes. The second role is that AI can create synthetic, anonymized data that can be shared more freely among ecosystem partners (Synthetic Data Will Transform How Banks Operate, Innovate and Compete). This used to be a novel and difficult concept to consider, but industries are increasingly jumping into it. Retailers and some manufacturers do this across their demand/supply chains. Allstate’s [Arity](https://arity.com/) aggregates driving data across the U.S. All of these examples help all the players in the ecosystem.

AI has the potential to create shockwaves at the ecosystem level, too (see Figure 4). For the ecosystems you lead or participate in, consider:

- Discovery of latent industry-level insights through AI analytics that can lead to breakthroughs, transforming entire industries.
- The emergence of new forms of currency and value exchange in a programmable economy, where AI facilitates tokenized incentives, smart contracts, and decentralized coordination across ecosystem participants.

Figure 4: Emerging Signs That AI Shockwaves Are Reshaping Your Landscape

##### How Do You Position Yourself for the Future?

Enterprises that move early to formulate strategies and begin adapting to the secondary and tertiary impacts of AI innovations will reap significant long-term rewards. On the other hand, enterprises with more myopic or short-term visions of these impacts will likely settle for immediate, first-order benefits like improving operating margins through automating tasks, curtailing hiring growth or reducing their workforce. Figure 5 offers a decision pathway enterprises should utilize for leveraging shockwaves. Figure 6 charts the spectrum of impact of AI shockwaves at the confluence of business model and industry disruption.

## Next Steps

---

1. **Consider the Following (****Planning and Discovery) Imperatives****:**
- Focusing solely on productivity risks missing transformative, expiring opportunities in innovation. **Discover the initiatives that will move you beyond efficiency** to embrace exploration and experimentation.
- Not every ripple is a revolution. To stay ahead, leaders must learn to **discern genuine shockwaves from the hype of the day.** Spot the signs early, assess your industry’s exposure and act swiftly to protect your value proposition.
- Bridge the gap between fast-moving AI innovation and the slower pace of institutional change. **Relentlessly refine your strategy** — anchoring it to evolving business goals, shifting market dynamics and the competitive pressures accelerated by AI
- **Reevaluate the core assumptions behind your business model** — many are being rendered obsolete daily. But make space for AI only where practical.
1. **Proactively Identify the Shockwaves That Will Impact Your Business Model and Industry**

C IOs should actively evaluate the potential impact of AI Shockwaves within their industries to stay ahead of transformative changes and maintain a competitive edge. An important step in this evaluation is the detection of evidence of AI shockwaves within your current business model and emerging industry structure. Key areas of inquiry might include:

**Questions on Impending Business Model Shifts**

- Are the capabilities that power our value propositions still using pre-AI, resource-intensive tasks and technologies that choke revenue or profit?
- Is the fundamental (standard-setting) technology of our business model undergoing (or about to undergo) disruptive change because of AI?

**Questions on Evolving Industry Dynamics**

- Are we observing significant improvement in the value propositions or profitability of certain of our competitors’ products, services or businesses?
- Is AI rewriting traditional workflows and practices in our industry such as it is in the manufacturing, customer service and healthcare sectors?
