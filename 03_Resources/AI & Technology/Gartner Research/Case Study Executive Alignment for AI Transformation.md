- **Company name:** Clifford Chance
- **Industry:** Legal
- **Headquarters:** London, U.K.
- **Revenue:** ~ £2.3 b illion (2024)
- **Employees:** 6,717 (2024)

## Case Overview

---

**Problem:**

- Demonstrating value from AI investments remains a key executive challenge. However, most leaders rely solely on use \- case ROI as a proxy for AI value, often overlooking indicators of transformation progress that are critical for value realization.
- While the long-term impact on employees remains unclear, AI is already disrupting human skills and behaviors, risking workforce readiness for the future.
- Ownership for AI initiatives is too fragmented to assess and capture AI’s transformative value, manifesting in the form of siloed and duplicative investments, inconsistent adoption, and exposure to unnecessary risks and vulnerabilities.

**Actions:**

- [Help CxOs understand the impact of AI on the business model](https://www.gartner.com/document-reader/document/?ref=solrResearch&refval=503640287&#id.2yeygqfekbp7)**:** Facilitate ongoing CxO conversations on how AI is reshaping the industry and enterprise, not just augmenting tasks.
- [Track the AI journey, not just use-case ROI](https://www.gartner.com/document-reader/document/?ref=solrResearch&refval=503640287&#id.1i99xi7dkcqv)**:** Monitor leading indicators that provide insight into the progress and challenges of the enterprise’s AI journey.
- [Scan and prepare for behavioral byproducts of AI](https://www.gartner.com/document-reader/document/?ref=solrResearch&refval=503640287&#id.of1hlblxhhzx)**:** Evaluate AI’s unintended consequences on employee behaviors and skills.
- [Formalize roles and structures for AI orchestration](https://www.gartner.com/document-reader/document/?ref=solrResearch&refval=503640287&#id.unbnhzvwrjdm)**:** Dedicate roles and build grassroot communities for enterprisewide AI enablement and oversight.

**Results:**

- Strengthened perception of IT as a key strategic partner enabling business growth.
- Greater employee engagement and job satisfaction as reported by the workforce.

## Problem

---

As more industries brace to be transformed by AI, enterprises make AI investments that can provide financial returns and/or returns on the future, not just return on employees (e.g., productivity, efficiency). In this context, a use \- case-centric approach to AI implementation limits enterprises’ ability to capitalize on the disruption and realize the value that they seek. C-suite leaders preoccupied with investing in attractive AI use cases risk overlooking foundational changes that are necessary to thrive in the AI era. A disproportionate focus on use cases also translates into relying on use \- case outcomes as a proxy for AI value. While outcome-based metrics are critical to gauging ROI, tracking use cases alone is insufficient to assess whether the enterprise AI transformation journey is heading in the right direction. Moreover, the narrow focus causes enterprises to focus on superficial impacts (e.g., adoption of new tools) rather than deeper implications (e.g., redefining roles and skill portfolios), leading to inadequate workforce preparedness for AI.

## Critical Components

---

Clifford Chance’s AI journey is marked by a gradual proliferation of AI interest from within IT to across the enterprise (see Figure 1). Being a part of an industry that is experiencing AI-led industry disruption has prompted executives at Clifford Chance to critically examine the impact of AI on their enterprise and establish an AI-accelerated ambition. This ambition precipitated a shift from using AI within the current boundaries of the business to redefining business and operating models for AI.

AI-accelerated ambition refers to the aspirations of enterprises to rapidly advance and innovate by using AI technologies to gain a competitive edge.

![Clifford Chance's AI journey involves three phases: IT-led tech push focusing on AI skill building, BU-led tech pull emphasizing AI adoption, and industry disruption analyzing AI's impact on business models. Stakeholders range from IT to executive leadership, addressing AI's effectiveness and ROI.](https://www.gartner.com/resources/833300/833323/Figure_1_Major_Milestones_in_Clifford_Chances_AIAccelerated_Journey.png)

Figure 1: Major Milestones in Clifford Chance’s AI-Accelerated Journey

### AI’s Business and Operating Model Impact Assessment

*Facilitate ongoing CxO conversations on how AI is reshaping the industry and enterprise, not just augmenting tasks.*

Recognizing the need to orient enterprise leaders to look beyond AI use cases, Clifford Chance’s CTO and his team elevate executive-level AI conversations to consider how AI might fundamentally impact their business and operating models, potentially disrupting existing sources of value altogether. To equip executives to assess AI’s impact on their business and operating models, Clifford Chance’s CTO curated a list of conversation prompts (see Figure 2).

![CIOs and CxOs are prompted to consider AI's impact on customer base, value propositions, pricing and core business capabilities. Key areas include governance, ethical AI use and workforce strategy, highlighting AI's transformative potential on business and enterprise models.](https://www.gartner.com/resources/833300/833323/Figure_2_CIOCxO_Conversation_Prompts_to_Chart_the_Shockwaves_of_AI_on_the_Enterprise.png)

Figure 2: CIO-CxO Conversation Prompts to Chart the Shockwaves of AI on the Enterprise

Strategically framed to explore AI’s effects on their customer base, value proposition, core business capabilities and financial models, these questions provoke leaders to think about AI’s long-term impact on their enterprise. For example, if AI enables clients to do some of the legal tasks that were traditionally done by outside counsel, how might that influence the firm’s value proposition for the future? And how should the workforce strategy be shaped to account for AI’s impact on human skills and competencies, particularly during the early career phases?

> — Paul Greenwood, CTO, Clifford Chance
> 
> “Executive AI education is not about how AI can reduce costs or increase productivity — it’s helping leaders understand how the forces of AI will impact our industry and the enterprise.”

### Tracking the AI Journey, Not Just Use-Case ROI

*Monitor leading indicators that provide insight into the progress and challenges of the enterprise’s AI journey.*

As leaders begin to make enterprisewide changes for AI (e.g., new business and operating models, reimagining core processes), value is no longer limited only to individual use cases. Additionally, use \- case metrics do not necessarily help leaders identify the underlying drivers influencing value. For example, use \- case metrics can reveal that AI has not improved billing efficiency as expected. But these metrics don’t help leaders root cause potential drivers behind the metric, which could be that employees experience high friction when using the tool or that they lack adequate training to use the tool’s features effectively. Enterprises that seek long \- term gains from their AI investments must ensure that their KPI mix includes metrics that focus not just on the goal but also the journey to get to it.

Clifford Chance tracks a portfolio of “metrics that matter,” which it refers to as AI journey KPIs (see Table 1). Encompassing organizational AI readiness, employee AI experience and enterprise AI brand, these KPIs provide leaders at Clifford Chance deeper insight into the progress they are making along their AI journey. Metrics in each KPI category are carefully curated and regularly updated to include any new identified AI journey markers.

Enterprise AI brand refers to how industry, talent market and clients perceive the enterprise’s AI efforts.

### Scanning and Preparing for Behavioral Byproducts of AI

*Evaluate AI’s unintended consequences on employee behaviors and skills.*

Tracking the enterprise AI journey also enables leaders at Clifford Chance to gauge the longer-term impacts of AI on their workforce. Clifford Chance realized that AI alters or eliminates experiences that allow its employees to build the knowledge, judgment and critical thinking necessary for their developmental and career progression.

Clifford Chance refers to these unintended consequences of AI on human skills, competencies and behaviors as “ b ehavioral b yproducts of AI.” Behavioral byproducts can be positive or negative. S canning for them helps leaders determine acceptable and unacceptable byproducts, further informing mitigation strategies for those that can negatively impact their enterprise. For example, a due diligence agent that acts on behalf of lawyers can weaken their creative reasoning. On the other hand, an AI-driven strategy partner that provides more opportunities to practice case deliberation might help junior lawyers get better at argumentation faster.

Clifford Chance’s AI transformation team facilitates ongoing conversations with executive leaders, managers and HR to ensure that they are prepared to manage these byproducts effectively and use those insights to inform their workforce strategy and change management approaches (see Figure 3).

![AI transformation teams must address skill atrophy by evaluating the importance of skills and providing alternatives for skill development. They should also consider how experience compression affects talent strategy, time savings and employee collaboration.](https://www.gartner.com/resources/833300/833323/Figure_3_Questions_to_Prepare_for_Behavioral_Byproducts_of_AI.png)

Figure 3: Questions to Prepare for Behavioral Byproducts of AI

### Formalized Roles and Structures for AI Orchestration

*Dedicate roles and build grassroot communities for en* *terprisewide* *AI enablement and oversight.*

![Clifford Chance's AI orchestration involves an AI and innovation board setting enterprise strategy, a transformation team enabling AI across functions and steering groups championing grassroots integration. Key roles include business and IT staff collaborating on continuous improvement and data science.](https://www.gartner.com/resources/833300/833323/Figure_4_Clifford_Chances_Structures_for_AI_Orchestration.png)

Figure 4: Clifford Chance’s Structures for AI Orchestration

At the top, the AI and i nnovation b oard establishes the enterprise AI ambition, strategic direction and AI governance. AI steering groups in each practice area (e.g., l itigation, i ntellectual p roperty) and corporate function (e.g., HR, f inance) contextualize AI practices and policies for their teams and drive adoption at the grassroots level.

Acting as the conduit between the AI and innovation board and local AI steering groups is Clifford Chance’s AI t ransformation team. This dedicated cross-functional standing team of about 35 employees is responsible for enabling transformative efforts enterprisewide. The cross-cutting nature of the AI transformation team provides visibility across different business areas, allowing the team to ensure AI execution aligns with and advances the broader enterprise AI strategy. For more detail on the responsibilities of these different structures, see Table 2.
