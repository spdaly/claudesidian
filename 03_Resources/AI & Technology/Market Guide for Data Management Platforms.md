A data management platform is an integrated and dynamic data environment for managing data with operational simplicity, catering to technical and business users’ needs. D&A leaders can use the technology in this emerging market to reduce silos, and to augment their data for current and innovative use cases.

## Overview

---

### Key Findings

- Data management platforms (DMPs) emerged to bridge data management technology silos, as the current data management solutions are fragmented. Gartner client interactions reveal that, on average, organizations have deployed a dozen data management solutions with overlapping functionalities, and they lack architectural flexibility.
- Increasing innovation and modernization demands have pushed organizations to modernize their data management technologies. According to the 2025 Gartner Chief Data and Analytics Officer Agenda Survey (n = 504), one in two CDAOs consider optimizing the technology landscape to be their primary responsibility.
- Smaller data management market subcategories like data lineage, reverse extract-transform-load (ETL), data preparation and data virtualization are becoming features of DMPs, and thus, less viable for enterprise investments as stand-alone solutions.

## Market Definition

---

Until recently, the wider data and analytics market primarily offered disjointed and single-point solutions for various aspects of data management. Gartner client interactions r eveal that, o n average, organizations deploy a dozen data management solutions. Managing a sprawl of technologies is extremely challenging for data management teams, especially integrating fragmented solutions. The integration of different systems requires various skills, techniques and budgets. This operational complexity has burdened data management teams and curtailed their innovation. Many data management leaders recognize these challenges and are transitioning from a sprawl of solutions to a single platform.

Furthermore, the market now offers data management platforms that promise operational simplicity through the convergence of several data management capabilities. A converged data management platform leverages metadata from every system in an integrated ap proach, thereby creating an opportunity to federate data management activities. It simplifies business users’ data consumption experience through flexible data access such as via common APIs, a semantic layer, natural language queries and AI assistants. Data management teams can benefit from the reduced technical overhead on operations and drive data engineering productivity.Organizations benefit from cost savings and improved ROI because of the simplified footprint.

#### Mandatory Features

The mandatory features (i.e., the bare minimum functionality) of DMPs are as follows:

- **Unified platform:** Data management capabilities — like data integration, metadata management and governance policy execution — are preintegrated as a platform using a common infrastructure that offers seamless and consistent interaction across the various capabilities.
- **Support for data persistence:** Capabilities to manage data storage in a durable manner with full multimodel support, enabling a full range of create, read, update and delete (CRUD) operations, and atomic, consistent, isolated and durable (ACID) compliance. Here, “support” indicates that the platform doesn’t have to persist data like a database, but support databaselike operations on persistent data; for example, pushdown and managing cloud object stores is acceptable.
- **Data integration:** Capabilities for extraction, ingestion, transformation and delivery of data using a combination of common data integration styles, such as batch data movement, data replication and synchronization, stream data integration and data virtualization.
- **Data quality:** Capabilities for data profiling, cleansing, validating business rules, identifying and resolving errors and outliers in data.
- **Data governance policy execution:** Capabilities that integrate governance controls directly into data pipelines, thereby guaranteeing governance and compliance consistency. The platform should support the governance of data across business domains, when necessary.
- **Platform-based pricing:** the platform offers serverless cloud computing via a consumption-based pricing model with common units (or platform credits). Additionally, the platform provides features to evaluate an organization’s consumption by different projects and workloads.

#### Common Features

The common features (i.e., the optional functionality) of DMPs are as follows:

- **Multipersona user experience:** Capabilities that enable data discovery, exploration and self-service data preparation for less-technical users. The platform should cater to both technical and business users’ needs with native support for workload management.
- **Flexible data access:** Capabilities that simplify business users’ data consumption experience on the platform such as via APIs, a semantic layer, natural language queries and AI assistants. These are common interfaces to how data is consumed from DMPs.
- **Data observability:** Capabilities that enable real-time monitoring data pipelines, data content, infrastructure and the platform costs. Additionally, the platform should support issue resolution and alter data consumers when the agreed SLAs are breached.
- **DataOps:** Capabilities that enable pipeline orchestration, dependency management, artifact change management (such as Git integration of data pipelines and data model version control), and automation of testing, environments and deployment activities.
- **FinOps:** Cloud financial management capabilities for the platform owners and administrator to receive proactive, reactive and product-centric ways of monitoring and reporting cloud compute costs for their data management workloads.
- **Data application development:** Capabilities that enable data teams to create and deliver data-centric applications. This feature provides a code-based developer environment by leveraging tools and languages such as Python and Jupyter Notebook.
- **AI model integration:** Capabilities necessary to support the delivery, maintenance and optimization of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) services that allow the platform users to create GenAI-based data applications for the business users, and to interact with external tools through interfaces like MCP.

## Market Description

---

Data management is a foundational discipline that addresses the complexity of state, store, access, quality and context of data that enables organizations to achieve their data aspirations using suitable data management solutions.

Figure 1 compares the current state of data management solutions against the emerging data management platforms market. For a full breakdown of current market subcategories, see Note 2: Current Data Management Market Categories.

![State of Data Management Solutions shows current state of fragmented solutions and the emerging state of unified platforms](https://www.gartner.com/resources/828800/828808/Figure_1_State_of_Data_Management_Market.png)

Figure 1: State of Data Management Market

Data and analytics (D&A) leaders responsible for data management report the need for a significant architectural overhaul for both existing and upcoming use cases as per latest survey findings. Over 35% of D&A leaders stated that while their current data management architecture can support some existing and new use cases, for innovative use cases (like building AI assistants) they need to significantly overhaul their data management architecture.<sup>1</sup>

Many D&A leaders responsible for data management recognize these challenges and are transitioning from a portfolio of stand-alone products to converged data management platforms. While using different vendor solutions, organizations hardly get an “integrated view” for data management out of the box. With a data management platform, data teams can benefit from the reduced operational complexity, drive data engineering productivity, save on license costs and improve return on investment (ROI) because of the simplified data management footprint.

The platform-centric approach is better placed to simplify modern data architectures such as logical data warehouse, data fabric and data lakehouse, as these architectures have multiple components supported by different product features of a converged data management platform. Gartner has observed the platform-centric demand from several clients in the past two years. For a few representative client questions, see Note 3: Buyer Demand for Data Management Platforms.

As the data management market reorients from a portfolio of stand-alone products into a “platform-centric view,” we are witnessing market consolidation through acquisitions and organic expansion of platform capabilities. See Note 4: Acquisitions in the Data Management Market.

## Market Direction

---

Organizations are evolving their thinking around the possibility of implementing integrated data management suites for better total cost of ownership (TCO), productivity and ROI benefits. Earlier this year, Gartner reported convergence as one of the major data management market themes for 2025-2028. (See Predicts 2025: 4 Ways AI Will Disrupt Data Management Markets and Solutions.)

In the near term (2025-2026), inorganic growth of vendor solutions will continue to enable more consolidated DMPs through acquisitions.Smaller market subcategories like data lineage and reverse ETL are folding through acquisitions, as these are becoming less impactful on their own for enterprise data management use cases. (See Note 4: Acquisitions in the Data Management Market.)

In the medium term (2026-2028), through engineering improvements with generative AI (GenAI) as the data interface, organizations can expect operational simplicity with DMPs. (See Innovation Insight: How Generative AI Is Transforming Data Management Solutions.)

In the far term (beyond 2028), DMPs are likely to evolve into data ecosystems, which provide a cohesive data management infrastructure that supports all data and analytics workloads. Data ecosystems are the ultimate end state of the data management market, which is offered as an interoperable ecosystem of multiple solutions. This category represents the superset of all data management use cases covered by data persistence, metadata and governance, and data fabric layers. (See Secure a Competitive Edge With Data Ecosystems: A Comprehensive Guide.)

In all these stages of market evolution, we recommend that D&A leaders focus on building their foundational data management architecture: the data fabric. Data fabric is the foundational data management architecture built for attaining flexible, reusable and augmented data pipelines and services that are enriched with business semantics. (See 2025 Strategic Roadmap for the Data Fabric Architecture.)

Some DMPs may provide a wholly managed, self-contained data management environment that supports regulatory and compliance concerns including data sovereignty, hybrid private cloud approaches and other use cases requiring tight control over where and how data is managed. The single-vendor approach of DMPs makes this more accessible than the multivendor coordination required by data ecosystems, which will take longer to mature.

For our estimate on the current and future market sizes, see Note 5: DMP Market Size Estimations.

> Data fabric is the common thread across the different stages of market evolution; that is, it is not affected by the changing market conditions. Therefore, when investing in data management platforms, make data ecosystems enabled by data fabric your goal.

## Market Analysis

---

The data management market is converging around different categories, including the persistence layer, the metadata layer, the fabric layer and the ecosystem layer. For further details on each category, see Future of Data Management Markets: Converged Data Management Platforms Drive Tool Consolidation.

Data management platform providers can be grouped under three distinct market segments, as seen in Figure 2.

![Three Data Management Platform Market Segments are application providers, cloud service providers and independent software vendors.](https://www.gartner.com/resources/828800/828808/Figure_2_Data_Management_Platform_Market_Segments.png)

Figure 2: Data Management Platform Market Segments

**Application providers —** In the past decades, application providers focused on business systems with controlled access to content, applications and data, limiting user interaction within the confines of that specific application. Organizations deployed these core applications dedicated to their operational needs such as for ERP, CRM, billing and payments; some also featured embedded analytics and AI capabilities. Now, application providers are extending into the data management market with dedicated platforms to avoid losing downstream workloads (such as analytics and data science workloads) to third parties. The term “extending” is used because this is a new market category for the app vendors. This segment has emerged into prominence rapidly over the last few months through acquisitions and strategic partnerships. Examples of such DMPs include Salesforce Data Cloud and SAP Business Data Cloud.

**Independent software vendors (ISVs) —** In the past, ISVs focused on offering stand-alone and point solution products to meet specific customer demands. They maintained neutrality toward applications and hyperscalers. Now, ISVs are offering stand-alone converged data management platforms with several preintegrated data management capabilities. This is largely in response to increasing customer demand (especially among large enterprises) for data management technology rationalization. Examples of such DMPs include Informatica Intelligent Data Management Cloud and Qlik Talend Data Fabric.

Each of those three categories are viable market segments for D&A leaders to consider in meeting their strategic data management platform objectives. Additionally, a combination of multiple DMPs is also possible in large enterprises. For example:

- An organization with a clear hybrid, multicloud approach would be inclined to use a DMP from an ISV, especially for use cases heavily reliant on on-premises data sources.
- In the same organization, a data team building innovative applications on a particular hyperscaler would be inclined to use the DMP from that hyperscaler.
- Also in the same organization, a domain team heavily invested in a domain application (for ERP, SCM, CRM, etc.) would use a DMP from this application vendor.

> With each additional service, a converged platform increases returned value, but becomes harder to replace.

## Evidence

---

<sup><strong>1 </strong></sup> **Gartner Chief Data and Analytics Officer Agenda Survey for 2025.** This survey was conducted to determine the agenda and strategic challenges of the chief data and analytics officer (CDAO) role or the office of the CDAO for 2025. It also sought to inform agenda planning or potential research topics for the data and analytics practice, and track the progress of the CDAO role in organizations. The research was conducted online from September through November 2024 among 504 respondents from across the world. Respondents were required to have a CDAO, chief data officer (CDO) or chief analytics officer (CAO) title; be the highest-level data and analytics leader in the organization; have the highest-level data and analytics leader reporting to them; or be the leader with data and analytics responsibilities in IT or in a business unit outside of IT. The survey sample was gleaned from a variety of sources (including LinkedIn), with the greatest number coming from a Gartner-curated list of 4,766 CDOs and other high-level data and analytics leaders. Disclaimer: The results of this survey do not represent global findings or the market as a whole, but reflect the sentiments of the respondents and companies surveyed.

## Note 1: Gartner’s Initial Market Coverage

## Note 5: DMP Market Size Estimations

---

The data management software market is estimated at approximately $150 billion software revenue by the end of 2025. The total addressable market (TAM) for DMPs is estimated at approximately $20 billion software revenue by the end of 2025. With an expected growth of 20% year-over-year for the next five years, the TAM for DMPs market will cross $50 billion by 2030.

The rationale for our TAM estimations is as follows:

- The current market penetration of DMPs is at 5% to 20%, as per [Hype Cycle for Data Management, 2025](https://www.gartner.com/interactive/hc/6700234).
- Assuming the incumbent vendors in this version of the Market Guide remain in the market over the next five years, we estimate that the DMP market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 20% year over year.
