- **Industry surveys** show pension funds "treading carefully" with governance and security concerns
- **Expected adoption** by 2035 suggests slower timeline than tech vendors predict

**Key Quote:** "Pension funds tread carefully in AI revolution. Governance and security concerns keep fiduciaries on sidelines as tech races ahead." - Pensions & Investments

**Why This Matters:**
Pension funds are fiduciaries with legal obligations - they can't move as fast as tech industry

### 2. Black Box Problem

**The Challenge:**
- Neural networks and deep learning provide superior accuracy
- BUT they lack interpretability ("black box" models)
- Regulators and trustees need explainability
- Tension between performance and transparency

**Industry Response:**

- Hybrid approaches (ML + traditional methods)
- Enhanced documentation and audit trails
- Model governance frameworks

### 3. Data Quality vs. Model Sophistication

**The Reality:**
- Advanced models require high-quality, labeled data
- Many pension funds have legacy systems with poor data quality
- "Garbage in, garbage out" applies
- Investment in data infrastructure may matter more than algorithm choice

**Practical Implication:**
May be better to use simpler models (Random Forest) with clean data than deep learning with messy data

### 4. Generative AI Hype vs. Discriminative AI Value

**Market Dynamics:**
- Most AI hype focuses on generative AI (ChatGPT, etc.)
- But discriminative AI may deliver more immediate value for pension funds
- Risk that funds invest in wrong type of AI for their needs
- Need to match technology to use case
