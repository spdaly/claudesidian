Application consolidation can be an effective instrument for IT cost optimization. However, enterprise application leaders must identify areas where application consolidation can help drive economies of scale as well as areas that aren’t ripe for standardization.

### Quick Answer

#### When does and doesn’t application consolidation make sense?

- Application consolidation works when the goal is economies of scale, or product and process consistency, or to manage a sprawling organization.
- Application consolidation may not work or be appropriate when, for example, there is tepid C-level commitment, there is no strategic benefit, and there are large and diversified sectors.
- Application consolidation may be challenged when there is a tradition of local autonomy and business units challenge corporate standardization efforts.

## More Detail

Enterprise application leaders are asked to consolidate duplicate and overlapping applications across business units to improve efficiency, and to reduce the cost and complexity of the application portfolio. Business units might have different business processes, for right or wrong reasons. To make application consolidation efficient and worthwhile, a mostly standardized business process and application implementation is required.

You need business support to make application consolidation effective. Business processes across business units need to be standardized and simplified. There might be cases where standardization is not rational or possible, or where business units are not willing and able to do it.

Enterprise application leaders need to identify the best opportunities and present their case by using the factors for and against consolidation in this research (see Table 1).

### When Application Consolidation Works

Application consolidation (see Figure 1) is an approach to application rationalization that reduces the complexity of the application landscape by getting as many business units as possible to use the same application for the same task. It goes beyond simply rationalizing the application portfolio to also standardizing how those applications are used, enabling process efficiencies and business cost savings.

Figure 1: Application Consolidation Without Business Transformation Delivers Limited Savings

Three categories of use cases in favor of application consolidation are discussed below:

- Economies of scale
- Product or process consistency
- Manage a sprawling organization

#### Economies of Scale

Some of the common reasons for consolidation to take advantage of size include:

- **Need to leverage size/scale:** Many companies have grown by acquisition, buying businesses in adjacent markets in their home territories to expand their offerings and similar businesses in other regions to become global. Until they change the local operating structure, they are simply running a holding company and won’t realize the synergies of the merger or acquisition.
- **To create a single** **face** **for the global customer:** Global customers get frustrated when they need to deal with separate sales forces with disparate systems for each brand and region of the world. If they operate consistently globally, they want their suppliers to also do so. The same applies to customer service and support.
- **Same customers, suppliers** **and materials/services:**Savvy customers can play multiple regional offices against each other to get lower prices. Suppliers like nothing more than each factory buying the same materials off-contract at full price. Strategic sourcing is a big benefit enabled by application consolidation. Coordinated buying and selling improves margins, lowers the cost of materials and reduces overall inventory.
- **Moving from national/regional to global business:** As with the customers mentioned above, companies are creating global product and service organizations to reduce duplication of administrative, sales, supply chain and R&D efforts. They are seeking to optimize these functions on a global basis.

#### Product or Process Consistency

Organizations may embark on a “one company” initiative to leverage the company’s people and assets more effectively and grow geographically. Application consolidation is used as a catalyst to force organizational and process change. Other reasons include getting company operations that may have been the result of mergers to have product or process consistency. Examples include:

- **Having many similar operations:** As companies try to consolidate, they find they have many similar operations around the world, such as sales offices, factories, distribution centers and stores. Two opportunities exist: consolidating facilities regionally for efficiency and tax advantages, and standardizing business processes to drive efficiency. This should be carefully balanced, however, as localized differences may provide a regional competitive advantage.
- **For brand and product/service consistency:** As companies expand globally, they want to leverage their brands across a wider area. Maintaining the brand promise is always hard, but is even harder if processes vary too much or data can’t be used between regions.
- **Excessive risk from process variation:** After waves of mergers, many pharmaceutical companies found that they were doing the same regulated processes differently at every plant. Each of these local processes had to be validated for compliance with current good manufacturing practices. Several leading companies are harmonizing those processes and the applications that support them to reduce regulatory risk.
- **Excessive cost from process variation:** Process variation is not only risky but also expensive. For example, financial reporting regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act require financial controls that need to be tested periodically. If each country or business unit uses different procedures and software, control testing must be done multiple times.

#### Manage a Sprawling Organization

Consolidation also helps to better manage a large, sprawling organization when you:

- **Need t** **o quickly shift talent between business units and regions to improve performance:** In a global world, you want to leverage global talent. Companies with common systems can send top-performing executives to struggling or emerging businesses, and they can hit the ground running without having to learn local processes and systems.

### When Application Consolidation Doesn’t Work

Consolidation isn’t for everyone. Sometimes, a holding company approach is the right way to manage a portfolio of independent businesses. Other times, the company and its management are not ready (or desperate enough) for the cultural change required. The need, willingness and rationale can differ by business function.

Good reasons not to standardize include:

- **Tepid C-level commitment:** If process standardization is not a corporate strategic objective driven by the CEO and accepted by local management, then don’t bother. Consolidation isn’t worthwhile.
- **No strategic goal/benefit from consolidation:** It isn’t worth doing application consolidation just for the IT benefits. It costs too much money, time and political capital. It adds risk to business execution and revenue. Similarly, it is not necessary to do an application consolidation simply to unite disparate business units around common dashboards and reports. There are other, less expensive means to accomplish that objective.
- **Large and diversified sectors:** Consolidation only makes sense if you can take advantage of the commonality of customers, suppliers, materials, services and processes. A $40 billion company may choose to standardize within each of its $10 billion sectors, if the businesses are different enough.
- **Very different value chains:** A division serving the fast-moving consumer goods market will have very different requirements and cycle times from one that is building capital equipment or providing financial services. Standardizing the processes will be impossible or provide low value.
- **Strong cultural differences require different management styles:** Some cultures may be more open to entrepreneurial methods, while others need strict hierarchies to function.
- **Different brand promises:** Processes may be intentionally different as part of a product-segmentation scheme. For example, one brand may offer low-cost, limited options and self-service, while another brand provides high-touch service and technical consulting.
- **Strong possibility of divestiture:** It’s obviously not worth consolidating the applications of a unit that isn’t strategic and may be divested in the short term.

### When Application Consolidation May Be Challenged

The change management issues are huge, and extra management effort is needed to overcome common excuses, such as:

- **“We’re different.”** Every company or business unit thinks it’s unique and needs to do things its own way. But the issue is often, “We’ve always done it that way.” You need to set the bar high on process differentiation and, rather than impose a process, bring the affected business unit process leads together until they agree on a common process that will work for all of them.
- **“We** ****have**** **to do it that way due to government regulations.”** This is a favorite of country-level organizations resisting consolidation. One effective way to test this is by asking for proof: “Share the text of the law or regulation so I can get up to speed with you.” If they can produce the regulation, an objective discussion can be had on how to comply. If not, this devolves into another “We’ve always done it that way” reason. This can be an especially acute problem for government agencies that each have processes, policies and regulations that have been developing independently for decades. They often predate computers and the ability to instantly have visibility over a wide geographic area. Successful consolidation may require rolling back to the core legislation governing operations and expenditures, and harmonizing policy and regulations on a broader scale.
- **“** **Our division/region/country has always delivered its P&L****, so leave us alone.”** A company with a strict P&L culture breeds insular behavior at the P&L level. The unit manager wants complete control of all the resources necessary to deliver the P&L that affects his or her bonus. This often leads to suboptimization of the enterprise as a whole.

> It can be rational to have multiple applications providing the same capability to support needed process or product variation.

Keep in mind that sometimes these claims are valid, in which case the appropriate strategy is to set a high bar for granting a deviation. Strong process governance using global process owners and escalation procedures are a must. Unless senior business leaders have the influence and will to establish the governance and hold everyone accountable, consolidation efforts will often fail.

This research is based on thousands of client interactions over 20 years.

<sup>1</sup> **2** **022 Gartner IT Services Buyers Survey:** This study was conducted to understand how the delivery and engagement model is evolving for IT services, how organizations are introducing sustainability as a criterion for selecting IT services providers, and the impact on IT service budgets in the next 12 months. The research was conducted online from August through October 2022 among 626 respondents from North America (n = 237), Asia/Pacific (n = 169), Western Europe (n = 168) and Latin America (n = 52) with at least $50 million in annual revenue. Organizations were from most industries, except agriculture, real estate, services and nonprofits/charities/NGOs, and were outsourcing IT services (infrastructure, applications or business process services) to a third-party vendor or contractor. An index was created to classify organizations into traditional and progressive organizations based on the stage of execution/plans of execution of changes in the IT services outsourcing delivery model. Respondents were required to have been personally involved in service provider identification, evaluation/selection or contracting in the last 24 months. Respondents were required to have a job title of manager or above, depending on the functional areas they were involved in (corporate/line-of-business leadership, application management, enterprise architecture and technology innovation, finance, human resources, infrastructure and operations, marketing, program and portfolio management and sourcing, or procurement and/or vendor management). *Disclaimer: Results of this survey do not represent global findings or the market as a whole, but reflect the sentiments of the respondents and companies surveyed.*
