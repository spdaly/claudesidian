### Key Insights

**1. Discovery-First is a Strength, Not Weakness**
Not knowing Seven Corners' top 10 inquiries = opportunity to position discovery as differentiator vs. generic vendors who guess.

**2. Microsoft Ecosystem Convergence**
Common patterns across Copilot Studio, GitHub Copilot, M365 Copilot:
- Phased rollout (Pilot → Expansion → Scale)
- Champion programs drive adoption
- 11 weeks to fluency
- Metrics-driven optimization

**3. ECIF as Competitive Moat**
ECIF-approved partner status = structural advantage (can offer customer savings competitors cannot match)

**4. May Deadline Creates Urgency**
ECIF funds exhaust by May → Seven Corners timing (Q4 start) is optimal for accessing fiscal year budget
