## Service Overview

Strategic advisory service helping mid-market and enterprise clients navigate the forced Power BI Premium → Microsoft Fabric migration while optimizing costs and evaluating AI/Copilot investments. We help organizations "thread the needle" between cost pressure and AI opportunity through platform rationalization.

---

## Value Proposition

> **"We help you invest strategically in AI capabilities while simultaneously reducing waste in your data platform. Most companies approach Fabric migration as a licensing decision. We approach it as a platform rationalization opportunity that funds AI investment through operational savings."**

### What Makes This Different

**We are NOT:**
- Microsoft partners selling licenses
- Big 4 delivering expensive, over-engineered solutions
- Training companies teaching button-pushing
- Tactical BI consultancies doing report optimization only

**We ARE:**
- Independent strategic advisors on platform rationalization
- AI readiness assessors using proven frameworks
- Cost optimization + strategic investment guides
- Enterprise architecture practitioners

---

## Target Market

### Market Opportunity

**Forcing Functions:**
- All P-SKU customers must transition to F-SKUs at renewal after Feb 1, 2025
- New P-SKU purchases ended July 1, 2024
- Power BI Pro licenses increased 40% ($10 → $14/month)
- Premium Per User increased 10% ($20 → $22/month)

**Market Timing:** Peak consulting opportunity NOW through Q4 2025

### Ideal Client Profile

**Company Size:** Mid-market (500-5,000 employees) to Enterprise (5,000+)

**Trigger Events:**
- P-SKU renewal notification received
- Budget pressure from license cost increases
- Interest in AI/Copilot capabilities
- Data platform sprawl and governance challenges

**Pain Points:**
1. **Cost Justification Under Pressure**: "Our costs are going up and we don't know if we can justify it"
2. **AI Investment Uncertainty**: "We want AI/Copilot but don't know if it's worth the investment"

**Decision Makers:**
- CIO / CTO
- VP Data & Analytics
- Enterprise Architecture
- CFO (for budget approval)

## Technical Foundation

### Key Decision Point: F64 Threshold

**Below F64** (F2-F32):
- Viewers require Pro licenses ($14/month each)
- No Copilot access
- Limited capacity

**F64 and above**:
- Free license users can view content (no per-user viewer cost)
- Copilot and advanced AI features enabled
- Break-even calculation: ~600 viewers

### SKU Equivalencies
- Premium P1 = Fabric F64 (~$8,410/month pay-as-you-go)
- Premium P2 = Fabric F128
- Premium P3 = Fabric F256
- Premium P4 = Fabric F512
- Premium P5 = Fabric F1024

### Billing Models
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Per-second billing, can pause/scale
- **Reserved (1-year)**: ~40% savings, includes on-prem PBIRS rights

## Differentiation & Integration

### Connection to Application Rationalization

Same proven playbook applied to data platforms:
1. **Eliminate waste** (redundant reports, unused capacity)
2. **Optimize operations** (right-size infrastructure)
3. **Fund modernization** (use savings for AI investment)

### Connection to AI Shockwave Framework

Power BI Copilot as **first contained AI use case**:
- Measurable ROI in analytics domain
- Governance forcing function (data quality, security)
- Foundation for broader AI strategy
- Real-world AI readiness test

### Connection to Microsoft ECIF Program

Fabric capacity may be fundable through:
- Azure consumption commitments
- Strategic Microsoft enterprise agreements

## Key Insights

1. **F64 is the strategic inflection point**: Economics fundamentally change (viewer costs disappear, AI unlocks)

2. **The tension IS the value prop**: Cost pressure vs. AI investment creates strategic dilemma clients need help resolving

3. **Migration is catalyst, not goal**: Use forced migration to fix underlying problems (sprawl, duplication, poor governance)

4. **Readiness matters more than features**: If data is a mess, AI just gives faster bad answers

5. **Limited time window**: 2025-2026 migration wave creates unique consulting opportunity
