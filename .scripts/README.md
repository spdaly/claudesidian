# Scripts Directory

Helper scripts for vault automation and web content capture.

## Available Scripts

### Attachment Management

These are primarily called via npm/pnpm commands in package.json:

- `update-attachment-links.js` - Updates note links after moving attachments
- `fix-renamed-links.js` - Fixes links after renaming files

### Web Content Capture

**Note**: These scripts require API keys to function:

#### firecrawl-scrape.sh

```bash
# Requires FIRECRAWL_API_KEY environment variable
.scripts/firecrawl-scrape.sh <url> <output_file>
```

#### firecrawl-batch.sh

Scrapes multiple URLs and auto-generates filenames.

```bash
# Requires FIRECRAWL_API_KEY environment variable

# Basic usage - saves to 00_Inbox/Clippings/
.scripts/firecrawl-batch.sh <url1> <url2> <url3>

# Custom output directory
.scripts/firecrawl-batch.sh -o 01_Projects/Research/ <url1> <url2>
.scripts/firecrawl-batch.sh --output-dir 03_Resources/Articles/ <url1> <url2>
```

### Transcript Extraction

#### transcript-extract.sh

Extracts transcripts from YouTube videos.

```bash
# Basic usage - saves to 00_Inbox/Clippings/
.scripts/transcript-extract.sh <youtube-url>

# Custom output directory
.scripts/transcript-extract.sh <youtube-url> 01_Projects/Research/
```
