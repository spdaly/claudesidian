# Research Summary: Hybrid Innovation Approach

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Purpose**: Deep dive into hybrid innovation models for Nokia presentation
**Focus**: Integration patterns, implementation strategies, and real-world applications

---

## Executive Summary

**Key Finding**: Modern innovation requires **hybrid approaches** that combine multiple frameworks rather than religious adherence to any single methodology.

**Two Primary Integration Patterns**:
1. **Nested Hybridization** - Embed iterative methods within Stage-Gate stages
2. **Handed-Over Hybridization** - Sequential application as project progresses

**Evidence**: Organizations using Design Thinking **and** Lean Startup **simultaneously** achieve superior results compared to choosing one framework.

## Key Themes

### Theme 1: The Case Against Single-Framework Fundamentalism

**Problem**: "Framework fundamentalism" - rigidly following one approach regardless of context

**Evidence from Research**:
> "Organizations achieve superior results by **simultaneously pursuing** Design Thinking and Lean Startup rather than choosing one."
> - Source: [[Innovation Frameworks#Complementarity]]

**Why Single Frameworks Fall Short**:

| Framework Alone | Strength | Weakness | Missing Element |
|-----------------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Stage-Gate Only** | Strong governance, risk management | Slow, bureaucratic, analysis paralysis | Customer discovery, rapid learning |
| **Design Thinking Only** | Customer empathy, problem discovery | No validation of business model | Market/financial validation |
| **Lean Startup Only** | Fast validation, MVP testing | May miss deep customer insights | Qualitative discovery of unarticulated needs |
| **Agile Only** | Fast execution, iteration | Assumes problem is known | Customer problem discovery, validation |

**Common Pitfall** ([[Innovation Frameworks#Common Pitfalls]]):
- **Framework fundamentalism**: Rigidly following one approach regardless of context
- **Skipping empathy**: Building MVPs without Design Thinking customer research
- **Premature scaling**: Moving to Agile development before validating with Lean Startup

**Source**: [[Innovation Frameworks#Implementation Considerations]]

---

### Theme 2: Complementarity of Design Thinking + Lean Startup

**Research Finding**: These frameworks address **different types of uncertainty** and work best together.

**Complementarity Matrix**:

| Dimension | Design Thinking | Lean Startup |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Primary Question** | What should we build? (WHO/WHAT) | Does it work? How to build it? (HOW/VALIDATION) |
| **Uncertainty Type** | Customer needs, problem definition | Business model viability, market fit |
| **Primary Method** | Qualitative research, prototyping | Quantitative experiments, MVPs |
| **Innovation Phase** | Front-end (fuzzy front end) | Back-end (go-to-market) |
| **Data Type** | Insights "tremendously hard to express in quantitative language" (HBR) | Measurable, actionable metrics |
| **Output** | Deep customer insights, desirability | Validated business model, feasibility |

**Source**: [[Innovation Frameworks#Complementarity: Design Thinking + Lean Startup]]

**Why They Work Together**:
1. **Design Thinking** uncovers **unarticulated needs** through empathy and ethnography
   - Customers can't always articulate what they need
   - Emotional dimensions ("tremendously hard to express in quantitative language")
   - Discovers **what problem to solve**

2. **Lean Startup** validates **business viability** through experiments
   - Tests if customers will actually **pay** for the solution
   - Validates **unit economics** and **scalability**
   - Proves **what solution works**

**Quote from Research**:
> "Design Thinking excels at front-end discovery (WHO has problem, WHAT solution), while Lean Startup excels at back-end validation (HOW to build, DOES IT WORK)"
> - Source: [[Innovation Best Practices#Start with Discovery, Not Solutions]]

---

### Theme 3: Two Integration Patterns (Nested vs. Handed-Over)

#### Pattern 1: Nested Hybridization

**Definition**: Embed iterative methods **within** Stage-Gate stages

**Visual Model**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    STAGE-GATE GOVERNANCE                │
│                    (Decision Points)                     │
├──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬────────────┤
│ Discovery│ Scoping  │ Dev      │ Testing  │ Launch     │
│          │          │          │          │            │
│ [DT      │          │ [Agile   │ [Lean    │            │
│ Workshop]│          │ Sprints] │ Expts]   │            │
└──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴────────────┘
    ↓          ↓          ↓          ↓          ↓
  Gate 1    Gate 2    Gate 3    Gate 4    Gate 5
```

**How It Works**:
- **Stage-Gate** provides governance backbone (decision points, resource allocation)
- **Design Thinking** workshops embedded in Discovery stage
- **Lean Startup** experiments embedded in Testing/Validation stage
- **Agile** sprints embedded in Development stage

**Benefits**:
- Maintains governance structure (accountability, risk management)
- Gains speed and learning from iterative methods
- Balances structure with flexibility

**Example - Agile-Stage-Gate** ([[Innovation Frameworks#Nested Hybridization]]):
- Use Agile sprints during Development stage
- Design Thinking workshops during Discovery stage
- Lean Startup experiments during Testing stage
- Stage-Gate provides governance, embedded methods provide execution approach

**When to Use**:
- Large investments requiring governance (>$5M)
- Regulated industries needing compliance
- Cross-business unit initiatives
- Organizations with established Stage-Gate culture

---

#### Pattern 2: Handed-Over Hybridization

**Definition**: Use different frameworks **sequentially** as project progresses through phases

**Visual Model**:
```
Phase 1          Phase 2          Phase 3
┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐
│  Design  │ →  │   Lean   │ →  │  Agile   │
│ Thinking │    │  Startup │    │   Dev    │
└──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘
(Discovery)     (Validation)     (Execution)

WHO/WHAT        HOW/DOES IT      BUILD/SCALE
                     WORK
```

**Recommended Sequence** ([[Innovation Frameworks#Complementarity]]):

**Phase 1: Design Thinking (Discovery)**
- **Duration**: 4-8 weeks
- **Goal**: Deeply understand customer problem and desired solution
- **Activities**:
  - Empathy interviews (15-25 customers)
  - Customer journey mapping
  - Problem definition
  - Low-fidelity prototyping
- **Output**: Value Proposition Canvas, problem statement, initial prototypes
- **Decision Point**: Is this problem worth solving? Do we understand customer deeply?

**Phase 2: Lean Startup (Validation)**
- **Duration**: 8-16 weeks
- **Goal**: Validate that solution works and can be monetized
- **Activities**:
  - Define leap-of-faith assumptions
  - Build MVPs to test assumptions
  - Run experiments with real customers
  - Measure actionable metrics
- **Output**: Validated Business Model Canvas, unit economics, product-market fit evidence
- **Decision Point**: Pivot or Persevere? Do customers pay? Does unit economics work?

**Phase 3: Agile (Development)**
- **Duration**: Ongoing 2-week sprints
- **Goal**: Build product iteratively with continuous feedback
- **Activities**:
  - Sprint planning and execution
  - Daily standups
  - Sprint reviews and retrospectives
  - Continuous integration/delivery
- **Output**: Shippable product increments
- **Decision Point**: Ship to broader market or iterate further?

**Benefits**:
- Match framework to phase and type of uncertainty
- Optimize approach as uncertainty reduces
- Clear handoffs between phases

**When to Use**:
- New business models (high uncertainty)
- Digital products/services
- Startups and corporate ventures
- When speed > governance rigor

### Theme 4: Real-World Implementation (Alexion Discovery Program)

**Company Profile**:
- **Industry**: Pharmaceuticals (subsidiary of AstraZeneca)
- **Size**: 2,500 employees, $6 billion revenue (2020)
- **Challenge**: Long product life cycles, highly regulated, "innovation doesn't work" mindset

**Source**: [[The anatomy of a successful innovation accelerator - a strategyzer webinar]]

**Program Structure**: 12-14 Week Hybrid Process

#### Alexion's 4-Phase Hybrid Model

- **Framework**: **Lean Startup** (MVP experiments, validated learning)

**Phase 4: Finish Line (Weeks 15-16)**
- Evidence-based recommendations
- Persevere / Pivot / Retire decisions
- **Framework**: Evidence-based decision-making

**2022 Results (12 Projects Across 2 Cycles)**:
- **2 projects (16%)**: Retired/"composted"
- **4 projects (33%)**: Transferred to business
- **6 projects (50%)**: Persevering in validation phase

**Key Success Factors** ([[Innovation Case Studies#Alexion Pharmaceuticals]]):

**1. Start Small Strategy**:
- Launched with limited visibility
- Found internal champions
- Proved value before seeking broader exposure
- Gradual introduction to stakeholders

- Avoid large bets
- Experiment with numerous smaller initiatives
- Learn from portfolio approach
- See what works through experimentation

**3. On-the-Job Training**:
- Training on methodology **plus** on-the-job experience
- Not traditional courses alone
- Expanded team's mindset
- Shift in way of working

**4. Cultural Transformation**:
- Deliberate shift in organizational culture
- Overcame "innovation doesn't work" mindset
- Leadership support paramount

**5. Strategic Backing (Not Innovation Theater)**:

- Tangible results focus
- Overcame lack of leadership support

**Challenges Overcome**:
- Fear of failure ("innovation doesn't work")
- Convincing leadership to invest without immediate ROI
- Balancing molecule innovation (pharma core) with other innovation types
- Long time horizons inherent to pharma

**Quote from Ankita Deshpande** (Head of Digital Health and Experience Innovation):
> "Many individuals and teams hesitate to innovate due to the fear of failure. This fear often stems from a mindset of 'innovation doesn't work' and a general disillusionment with the innovation process."

**Innovation Beyond Technology**:
> "Innovation should not be confined to technology; it's about creating value for customers, the organization, and, in some cases, society at large."

### Theme 5: Framework Selection Decision Matrix

**Choose Based on Four Dimensions** ([[Innovation Frameworks#Framework Selection]]):

#### Dimension 1: Project Type

| Project Type | Recommended Approach | Rationale |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Incremental improvement** | Agile alone | Known problem, known solution, focus on execution |
| **New product development** | Stage-Gate + embedded Agile | Need governance + iterative dev |
| **New business model** | DT → Lean Startup sequence | High uncertainty in customer + business model |
| **Disruptive innovation** | Full hybrid (all frameworks) | Maximum uncertainty across all dimensions |

#### Dimension 2: Market Maturity

| Market Maturity | Recommended Approach | Rationale |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Established market** | Lean Stage-Gate + customer validation | Structure needed, but validate assumptions |
| **Emerging market** | DT + Lean Startup for exploration | Need discovery + validation, less structure |
| **Unknown market** | Heavy DT emphasis + experimentation | Maximum learning required |

#### Dimension 3: Technology Uncertainty

| Technology Uncertainty | Recommended Approach | Rationale |
|------------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Proven technology** | Streamlined Stage-Gate | Low tech risk, focus on execution |
| **New technology application** | Agile-Stage-Gate + technical sprints | Need iteration to de-risk tech |
| **Breakthrough technology** | DT + extensive prototyping | Need discovery + tech validation |

#### Dimension 4: Learning Gap

| Learning Gap | Recommended Approach | Rationale |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Known customer needs** | Skip extensive discovery, focus execution | Can move to validation/development |
| **Unknown customer needs** | Start with DT empathy work | Need qualitative discovery |
| **Unknown viability** | Emphasize Lean Startup validation | Need quantitative market validation |

**Decision Framework Summary**:
- **High uncertainty** (customer + market + tech) → Full hybrid (DT → Lean → Agile)
- **Medium uncertainty** (1-2 unknowns) → Targeted hybrid (embed specific methods in Stage-Gate)
- **Low uncertainty** (execution focus) → Agile or Lean Stage-Gate

---

### Theme 6: Governance Tailoring by Risk Level

**Principle**: Governance rigor should match investment size and strategic risk

**Three Governance Tiers** ([[Innovation Processes and Governance#Tailoring Governance Rigor]]):

#### High Governance (Multi-gate, Detailed Reviews)
**When to Use**:
- Large capital investments (>$5M)
- Regulated industries
- High strategic risk
- Cross-business unit impact

**Approach**:
- Full Stage-Gate process (5-6 gates)
- Detailed business cases required
- Senior leadership gate reviews
- Comprehensive risk assessment
- Nested hybridization (embed DT/Lean/Agile within stages)

**Example**: Pharmaceutical product development (Alexion context)

---

#### Medium Governance (Streamlined Gates)
**When to Use**:
- Medium investments ($500K - $5M)
- Moderate risk
- Single business unit
- Established market

**Approach**:
- 3-4 key gates (Concept, Business Case, Launch)
- Innovation Review Board approval
- Balanced documentation (not exhaustive)
- Handed-over hybridization (sequential DT → Lean → Agile)

**Example**: New product feature or service offering

---

#### Low Governance (Fast-Track, Delegated Authority)
**When to Use**:
- Small investments (<$500K)
- Low risk
- Incremental innovation
- Rapid experimentation

**Approach**:
- 1-2 gates (Concept approval, Launch decision)
- Team lead approval with post-review reporting
- Lightweight documentation
- Agile or Lean Startup alone

**Example**: A/B testing, feature experiments, quick wins

---

**Agile Governance Principles** ([[Innovation Best Practices#Balance Structure with Speed]]):
- **Continuous reviews** vs. discrete gates
- **Incremental funding** vs. full phase funding
- **Empowered teams** vs. centralized control
- **Learning metrics** vs. only financial metrics
- **Adaptive planning** vs. fixed plans

**Hybrid Approach**:
- Major gates for significant funding decisions (Gate 2, 4, 5)
- Sprint reviews for continuous validation (within stages)
- Delegated decision authority to innovation teams (within budget)
- Escalation path for strategic or high-risk decisions

---

## Contradictions/Tensions

### 1. Structure vs. Speed

**Tension**: Stage-Gate governance (slow, structured) vs. Lean Startup/Agile (fast, iterative)

**Apparent Contradiction**:
- Stage-Gate emphasizes thorough analysis, comprehensive business cases
- Lean Startup emphasizes build-measure-learn, fast experiments
- Can't do both?

**Resolution**:
- **Tailor rigor to risk** (High/Medium/Low governance tiers)
- **Nested hybrid**: Stage-Gate for major decisions, iterative methods for execution
- **Time-box planning**: 2-4 weeks for concept, 4-6 weeks for business case (not months)
- **Agile business cases**: Living documents updated as you learn

**Source**: [[Innovation Best Practices#Pitfall 2: Over-Planning, Under-Experimenting]]

---

### 2. Qualitative vs. Quantitative

**Tension**: Design Thinking (qualitative, empathy) vs. Lean Startup (quantitative, metrics)

**Apparent Contradiction**:
- Design Thinking values insights "tremendously hard to express in quantitative language"
- Lean Startup emphasizes actionable metrics, A/B testing, quantitative validation
- How to balance?

**Resolution**:
- **Sequential application**: DT first (qualitative discovery) → Lean second (quantitative validation)
- **Complementary data**: Qualitative explains **why**, quantitative proves **how much**
- **Both needed**: Customer quotes (DT) **and** NPS scores (Lean)
- **Pair in dashboards**: Charts **and** narratives

**Source**: [[Innovation Metrics and KPIs#Pair Quantitative with Qualitative]]

---

### 3. Customer-Driven vs. Visionary

**Tension**: User-centric design (listen to customers) vs. visionary innovation (Steve Jobs "people don't know what they want")

**Apparent Contradiction**:
- Design Thinking: Deep empathy, observe users, co-create
- Visionary approach: Lead market with bold vision customers can't articulate

**Resolution**:
- **Design Thinking for refinement**: Excels at improving within constraints
- **Not sufficient for radical reimagining**: DT can reinforce status quo (see critical perspective)
- **Combine approaches**: DT uncovers **unarticulated needs**, vision defines **bold solution**
- **Example**: iPhone - DT research on mobile frustrations + Jobs' vision of elegant simplicity

**Source**: [[Design Thinking Is Fundamentally Conservative and Preserves the Status Quo]]

---

### 4. Empowerment vs. Accountability

**Tension**: Agile teams need autonomy vs. leadership needs control

**Apparent Contradiction**:
- Agile principles: Self-organizing teams, minimal hierarchy
- Stage-Gate governance: Clear approval authority, senior leadership decisions

**Resolution**:
- **RACI clarity**: Exactly one Accountable person per decision
- **Empowered within boundaries**: Teams decide execution, leadership decides major investments
- **Delegated authority by investment size**:
  - <$100K: Team lead approval
  - $100K-$1M: Innovation Review Board
  - >$1M: Steering Committee
- **Escalation paths**: Strategic/high-risk decisions escalate

**Source**: [[Innovation Processes and Governance#RACI Matrix]]

## Strategic Recommendations

### For Client Engagement

**Discovery Questions**:
1. "What innovation frameworks do you currently use?"
2. "How do you handle projects with high customer uncertainty vs. high market uncertainty?"
3. "Where do innovation projects typically fail? (Discovery, validation, execution)"
4. "How do you balance governance rigor with speed to market?"
5. "What's your current portfolio balance? (H1/H2/H3 or incremental/transformational)"

**Value Proposition**:
1. **Proven Integration**: Battle-tested by Alexion, GE, IBM
2. **Context-Aware**: Not one-size-fits-all; tailored by risk level
3. **Evidence-Based**: Research shows hybrid > single framework
4. **Practical Roadmap**: 12-16 week pilot → scale → embed

**Differentiation**:
1. **Not Framework Fundamentalism**: We integrate best practices from multiple methodologies
2. **Governance + Speed**: Nested hybridization maintains accountability while accelerating learning
3. **Portfolio Perspective**: Different projects suit different hybrid patterns (H1 ≠ H3)
4. **Cultural Foundation**: We address culture **and** process (not process alone)
