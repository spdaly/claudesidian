# Five-Stage Innovation Model: Nokia Application Guide

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Project**: [[Nokia Innovation Presentation]]
**Framework Reference**: [[Five-Stage Innovation Model (Desirable-Feasible-Viable-Scalable-Adaptable)]]

---

## Purpose

This document provides practical guidance for applying the five-stage innovation model (Desirable → Feasible → Viable → Scalable → Adaptable) to Nokia's innovation program, including the 16-week Discovery pilot and ongoing portfolio management.

---

## Nokia Context: Hardware → Software Transformation

**Challenge**: Nokia is transitioning from network equipment manufacturing excellence to software platforms, 5G solutions, and cloud infrastructure—requiring both hardware reliability AND software agility.

**Parallel**: This is the same transformation GE Software successfully navigated using design thinking and hybrid innovation frameworks.

**Five-Stage Relevance**: Nokia needs innovations that are:
1. **Desirable** - Network operators and enterprise customers actually want them
2. **Feasible** - Nokia can build them with telecom-grade reliability
3. **Viable** - Business models work in competitive software markets
4. **Scalable** - Solutions work globally across diverse customer contexts
5. **Adaptable** - Platforms evolve with rapid technology changes (5G → 6G, AI, edge computing)

## Integration with Nokia's 6-Phase Stage-Gate Model

### Current Nokia Stage-Gate → Five-Stage Mapping

| Nokia Phase | Primary Five-Stage Focus | Concurrent Evaluation |
|-------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Phase 1: Ideation & Discovery** | **Desirable** | Also evaluate: Feasible (early technical feasibility check) |
| **Phase 2: Concept Development & Scoping** | **Desirable + Feasible** | Also evaluate: Viable (business model hypothesis), Scalable (architecture considerations) |
| **Phase 3: Business Case Development** | **Feasible + Viable** | Also evaluate: Scalable (operational requirements), Adaptable (platform vs. point solution) |
| **Phase 4: Development & Validation** | **Viable + Scalable** | Also evaluate: Adaptable (API design, ecosystem enablement) |
| **Phase 5: Testing & Piloting** | **Scalable** | Also evaluate: Viable (validate at scale), Adaptable (customer feedback loops) |
| **Phase 6: Launch & Scale** | **Scalable + Adaptable** | All five dimensions continuously monitored |

**Key Insight**: While each phase has a PRIMARY focus, ALL FIVE dimensions should be evaluated at EVERY gate to surface future risks early.

## 16-Week Discovery Pilot: Five-Stage Application

### Week 1-2: Onboarding
**Primary Focus**: Define innovation scope and strategic themes

**Five-Stage Activity**:
- **Identify innovation type** (Efficiency/Sustaining/Transformative) for each pilot project
- **Determine required stages** based on type:
  - Efficiency: Feasible → Viable → Scalable
  - Sustaining/Transformative: Full five-stage progression
- **Set stage-specific success criteria** for the 16-week timeline

**Example**: If piloting "AI-Driven Network Optimization" (Sustaining Innovation):
- Week 1-6: Focus on Desirable (Do network operators want AI-driven optimization?)
- Week 7-14: Focus on Feasible + Viable (Can we build it? Will they pay for it?)
- Week 15-16: Assess Scalable + Adaptable readiness for next phase

---

### Week 3-6: Design-Test Loop
**Primary Focus**: Desirable (Customer empathy and problem validation)

**Five-Stage Evaluation Template**:

**✓ Desirable** (PRIMARY):
- Customer journey maps for network operators/enterprise customers
- Pain point validation through interviews
- Emotional resonance testing (frustration, anxiety, confidence)
- Willingness-to-pay signals
- **Gate Question**: Is there compelling customer need worth pursuing?

**? Feasible** (EARLY CHECK):
- Technical feasibility scan (no deep prototyping yet)
- Identify technical risk areas requiring validation
- Assess if Nokia has/can acquire necessary capabilities
- **Gate Question**: Any insurmountable technical barriers visible now?

**? Viable** (HYPOTHESIS):

**? Adaptable** (STRATEGIC CHECK):
- Is this a platform play or point solution?
- Does it align with long-term technology roadmap (6G, AI, edge)?
- **Gate Question**: Does this enable future innovation or lock us in?

---

### Week 7-14: Experimentation
**Primary Focus**: Feasible + Viable (MVP testing and business model validation)

**Five-Stage Evaluation Template**:

**✓ Desirable** (REVALIDATE):

- Customer acquisition cost vs. lifetime value acceptable
- Repeatable sales motion identified
- Competitive positioning validated
- **Gate Question**: Does business model work with real customer data?

**? Scalable** (PLANNING):
- Scalability architecture designed
- Operational playbook drafted
- Growth projections modeled
- **Gate Question**: What needs to happen to scale this?

**? Adaptable** (ARCHITECTURE):
- API design enables ecosystem participation
- Platform architecture allows iteration
- Technology stack supports evolution
- **Gate Question**: Are we building for continuous evolution?

---

### Week 15-16: Decision Point
**Primary Focus**: Comprehensive five-stage evaluation for Persevere/Pivot/Retire decision

**Decision Matrix**:

| Stage | Evidence Required | Go/Pivot/Kill Criteria |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Desirable** | Customer research, MVP feedback, willingness-to-pay | **GO**: Strong demand validated. **PIVOT**: Weak demand, try different segment/value prop. **KILL**: No demand found |
| **Feasible** | Working prototype, resource plan, architecture | **GO**: Technically proven. **PIVOT**: Technical barriers found, explore alternative approach. **KILL**: Insurmountable technical barriers |
| **Viable** | Unit economics, market size, competitive advantage | **GO**: Positive economics. **PIVOT**: Economics weak, adjust pricing/costs. **KILL**: Cannot achieve acceptable margins |
| **Scalable** | Scalability plan, operational assessment | **GO**: Scalable architecture. **PIVOT**: Scalability concerns, redesign approach. **KILL**: Fundamentally unscalable |
| **Adaptable** | Platform architecture, ecosystem strategy | **GO**: Built for evolution. **PIVOT**: Too rigid, add adaptability. **KILL**: Locks Nokia into obsolete tech |

**Outcome Categories**:
1. **Persevere** (Continue to Full Development): All five stages show positive signals
2. **Pivot** (Change Strategy): Some stages weak, but opportunity still viable with course correction
3. **Retire** (Kill Project, Harvest Learnings): Critical stages failed, no viable path forward

**Portfolio Health**: Healthy pilot should have mix of outcomes (not 100% persevere - signals gates lack teeth)

## Gate Review Enhancement: Five-Stage Evaluation Checklist

### How to Use at Each Nokia Stage-Gate Review

**Before the Gate Meeting**:
1. Innovation team completes five-stage evaluation (see templates below)
2. Identifies which stages are validated, which need more work, which are at risk
3. Prepares evidence for each stage

**During the Gate Meeting**:
1. Present status across all five dimensions (not just primary focus for this phase)
2. Highlight risks in future stages discovered during current phase
3. Make go/pivot/kill recommendation based on holistic assessment

**After the Gate Meeting**:
1. Document decision rationale across all five stages
2. If "Go": Define success criteria for next phase across all relevant stages
3. If "Pivot": Specify which stage(s) triggered pivot and what changes
4. If "Kill": Document learnings by stage for knowledge capture

**Status**: Built for continuous evolution, platform architecture sound

---

**GATE 3 DECISION RECOMMENDATION**:
**PIVOT** - Address scalability concerns before proceeding to full development

**Rationale**:
- Desirable, Feasible, Viable, Adaptable all validated ✅
- Scalable shows significant risk 🔴
- Risk is addressable (operational plan refinement, field training program)
- Opportunity too valuable to kill

**Required Actions Before Gate 3 Approval**:
1. Develop detailed operational rollout plan with field ops team
2. Create global field engineer training program (budget and timeline)
3. Refine edge infrastructure plan (phased rollout vs. big bang)
4. Re-model unit economics including operational costs at scale
5. Present revised scalability plan at Gate 3 review in 4 weeks

**If Scalable Addressed**: Strong GO to Phase 4 (all five stages validated)

---

## Key Takeaways for Nokia

1. **Use five stages as concurrent lenses**, not just sequential stages - evaluate all five at every gate
2. **Surface future risks early** - Gate 1 should identify potential Gate 4 problems
3. **Tailor to innovation type** - Efficiency innovations follow different path than Transformative
4. **Maintain healthy kill rates** - Not every innovation should pass every gate (50-70% kill at Gate 1 is healthy)
5. **Create shared language** - Portfolio discussions become clearer when everyone uses five-stage framework
6. **Integrate, don't replace** - Enhance existing Stage-Gate process, don't throw it away
7. **Focus on "Adaptable"** - This is the stage missing from traditional frameworks, critical for software platforms
