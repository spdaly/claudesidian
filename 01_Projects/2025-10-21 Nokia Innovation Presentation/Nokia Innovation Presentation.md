**1. Empathy with Users** (Icon: Heart + person)
- Deep understanding of needs, pain points, emotions
- Customer journey mapping

**2. Design Artifacts as Strategy** (Icon: Whiteboard/canvas)
- Journey maps, value propositions, prototypes
- Strategic tools, not just documentation

**3. Prototyping & Iteration** (Icon: Cycle arrows)
- "Demo or die" (MIT Media Lab)
- Learn by building, not predicting

**4. Tolerance for Failure** (Icon: Safety net)
- "Learning moments" not failures
- Psychological safety required

**5. Bias Toward Simplicity** (Icon: Minimalist design)
- Deliberate decisions about what NOT to do
- Constrained focus beats feature bloat

**Speaker Notes**:
- These principles transcend product design—they infuse culture
- Empathy: Understanding customer emotional experience, not just functional requirements
- Artifacts: Visual tools that enable strategic thinking and communication
- Prototyping: Only way to transform ideas into value
- Failure: Iteration requires psychological safety
- Simplicity: Saying no is as important as saying yes

---

## Slide 7: When Design Thinking Works Best

**Visual**:
- Grid layout showing ideal contexts

**Front-End Innovation** ✓
- Discovering WHO has the problem

**Speaker Notes**:
- This isn't a trend—it's a response to complexity
- When strategy firms acquire design agencies, it signals fundamental shift
- Design thinking now expected competence in enterprise consulting
- Question for Nokia: Will you lead or follow this shift?

---

## Slide 9: Core Principle #1 - Empathy with Users

**Visual**:
- Large customer journey map example (simplified)

**Journey Phases** (left to right):
1. **Awareness** - Customer discovers need
2. **Evaluation** - Compares solutions
3. **Decision** - Selects vendor
4. **Implementation** - Deploys solution
5. **Operation** - Uses daily
6. **Renewal** - Stays or switches

**Emotional Line Graph** (overlaid):
- Shows emotional highs (peaks) and lows (valleys) at each phase
- Pain points marked with ⚠️ icons
- Delight moments marked with ✨ icons

**Example Pain Point Callout**:
- "Week 3 of implementation: Frustration peak when old and new systems conflict"

**Quote**:
> "This form of artifact helped us develop a strategic way to think about changing the entire organization." — Melissa Chapman, VA Center for Innovation

**Speaker Notes**:
- Journey maps visualize emotional experience, not just process steps
- VA used this exact tool to transform entire healthcare system
- B2B customers have emotions too—frustration, confidence, anxiety, satisfaction
- Question: Have we mapped Nokia customer emotional journey?

---

## Slide 10: Core Principle #2 - Design Artifacts as Strategy

**Visual**:
- Two columns showing transformation

**Left: Traditional Strategic Tools**
- Spreadsheets (icon)

## Slide 11: Core Principle #3 - Prototyping & Iteration

**Visual**:
- Comparison infographic

**Old Approach: Predict-Plan-Build**
```
[Research 6mo] → [Requirements 3mo] → [Design 4mo] → [Build 12mo] → [Test 3mo] → [Launch]
Total: 28 months
```
- Linear process
- Big reveal at end
- High risk if wrong

**New Approach: Build-Measure-Learn**
```
[Prototype] → [Test] → [Learn] → [Iterate] ↩️ (Repeat weekly)
Total: Continuous cycles
```
- Iterative process
- Learning every week
- Risk reduced through validation

**Quote**:
> "GE is moving away from exhaustive product requirements. Teams learn what to do in the process of doing it, iterating, and pivoting." — Greg Petroff, Chief Experience Officer, GE Software

**MIT Media Lab Motto**:
> "Demo or die"

**Speaker Notes**:
- GE quote is key—exact parallel to Nokia situation
- Traditional telecom: exhaustive requirements before build
- Software reality: Requirements emerge through iteration
- "Demo or die": Only prototyping transforms ideas into value

---

## Slide 12: Core Principle #4 - Psychological Safety

**Visual**:
- WD-40 Culture Formula (center, large):

```
Culture = Values + Behavior × Consistency
```

**Four quadrants around formula**:

**Top Left - CEO Role**
Quote: "Creating the environment where people explore is the CEO's job." — Gary Ridge, WD-40 CEO

**Top Right - Language Change**
- Old: "Failure"
- New: "Learning moments"
- Result: Safe space for experimentation

**Bottom Left - Humility**
Quote: "The three most powerful words a leader can say: 'I don't know.'"

**Bottom Right - Results**
- Global expansion achieved
- Product innovation culture established
- Employee engagement increased

**Speaker Notes**:
- WD-40 transformed from insular to global innovator through culture change
- Culture change enabled innovation, not the other way around

**Red Flags** (callout boxes):
- ⚠️ >90% in H1 = Underinvesting in future
- ⚠️ >30% in H3 = Unsustainable risk

**Speaker Notes**:
- Balanced portfolio essential for long-term health
- H1 generates cash to fund H2/H3
- H2/H3 create future growth engines
- Amazon example: Warehouse robots (H1), Kindle (H2), AWS (H3)
- Question for Nokia: What's current portfolio balance?

---

## Slide 16: Governance That Enables vs. Constrains

**Visual**:
- Two contrasting scenarios

**LEFT: Innovation Theater 🎭**
- Gate reviews are rubber stamps
- No real decision-making
- Projects never killed
- Metrics focus on activity (# of ideas)
- Result: Wasted resources, no impact

**RIGHT: Meaningful Governance ✅**
- Gates have teeth—projects get killed
- Clear must-meet criteria
- Evidence-based decisions
- Metrics focus on outcomes (value created)
- Result: Efficient portfolio, real innovation

**Healthy Kill Rates by Gate** (table):
| Gate | Healthy Kill Rate |
|------|------------------|
| Gate 1 (Concept) | 50-70% killed |
| Gate 2 (Business Case) | 20-40% killed |
| Gate 3 (MVP Validation) | 30-50% pivoted or killed |
| Gate 4 (Launch) | 10-20% killed |

**Quote**:
> "Celebrate intelligent failures. Share learnings from experiments that invalidated assumptions."

**Speaker Notes**:
- Low kill rates signal rubber-stamp gates (innovation theater)
- High kill rates early = healthy portfolio management
- Alexion example: 12 projects → 2 retired, 4 to business, 6 persevering
- Portfolio approach normalizes some projects failing
- Question: What's Nokia's current kill rate?

---

## Slide 17: Metrics - Three-Tier Framework

**PROCESS METRICS** (Middle of funnel)
- Cycle time (idea → launch)
- Experiment velocity (tests per month)
- Kill rate at gates
- Pipeline health (projects per stage)
- **Purpose**: Is our process effective?

**OUTPUT METRICS** (Bottom of funnel)
- New product revenue (% from products <3 years old)
- Customer satisfaction (NPS, adoption rates)
- Market share in new segments
- ROI on innovation investments
- **Purpose**: Are we creating value?

**Callout - Innovation Accounting**:
- Traditional: "Will generate $10M in Year 2" (unprovable until Year 2)
- Validated Learning: "70% of test users will use 3x/week" (testable in 4 weeks)

**Speaker Notes**:
- Avoid vanity metrics (# of ideas submitted)
- Focus on outcomes, not just activities
- Early-stage projects need different metrics than mature products
- Innovation accounting bridges the gap

# WORKSHOP SECTION (15 minutes)

---

## Interactive Activity 1: Customer Journey Mapping (7 min)

**Setup**:
- Break into 3-4 small groups
- Each group gets large paper, markers, sticky notes

**Exercise**:
"Map the emotional journey of a Nokia enterprise customer (e.g., CIO deploying 5G private network)"

**Phases to Map**:
1. Awareness (discovering need)
2. Evaluation (comparing Nokia vs. competitors)
3. Decision (selecting vendor)
4. Implementation (deploying solution)
5. Operation (daily use)
6. Renewal (stay or switch)

**For Each Phase**:
- What does customer think/feel/do?
- Emotional high or low?
- Pain points (⚠️) and delight moments (✨)

**Debrief Questions**:
- Where are biggest pain points?
- Where does Nokia excel vs. struggle?
- What insights surprised you?

---

## Interactive Activity 2: Portfolio Assessment (5 min)

**Setup**:
- Individual reflection, then group discussion

**Exercise**:
"Estimate Nokia's current innovation portfolio balance"

**Grid to Fill Out**:
- Horizon 1 (Core): ___% of innovation resources
- Horizon 2 (Adjacent): ___% of innovation resources
- Horizon 3 (Transformational): ___% of innovation resources

**Reflection Questions**:
1. Are we over-indexed on H1 (>90%)?
2. Do we have enough H2/H3 to create future growth?
3. What would ideal balance look like for Nokia?

**Group Discussion**:
- What did people estimate?
- Where is there alignment/disagreement?
- What does this tell us about current state?

---

## Q&A (3 minutes)

**Anticipated Questions & Talking Points**:

**Q: "How long does this transformation take?"**
A: GE/IBM took 2-3 years to show meaningful impact. Our roadmap is 24 months but pilot shows results in 16 weeks.

**Q: "What's the investment required?"**
A: IBM invested $100M for 1,000 designers. Nokia should start smaller—pilot <$500K, scale based on results. External partnership typically $1-2M/year.

**Q: "Can we do this with existing staff or need to hire?"**
A: Both. Train existing teams (internal capability) + hire strategic designers + engage external partnership (GE model). Not all at once—phased approach.

**Q: "How do we balance reliability requirements with experimentation?"**
A: Tailor governance to risk. Fast-track low-risk experiments. Maintain rigorous gates for safety-critical systems. GE managed this tension successfully.

**Q: "What if our culture isn't ready?"**
A: Readiness assessment identifies gaps. Cultural change is prerequisite, not consequence. Leadership must model learning and vulnerability. WD-40 showed it's possible to transform culture deliberately.

**Q: "How do we measure success?"**
A: Three-tier metrics (input/process/output). Early: Focus on learning metrics. Later: New product revenue, customer satisfaction, market share.
