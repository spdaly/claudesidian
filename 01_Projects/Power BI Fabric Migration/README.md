## Service Summary

### Value Proposition

> "We help you invest strategically in AI capabilities while simultaneously reducing waste in your data platform. Most companies approach Fabric migration as a licensing decision. We approach it as a platform rationalization opportunity that funds AI investment through operational savings."

### Target Clients

- **Size**: Mid-market (500-5,000 employees) to Enterprise (5,000+)
- **Trigger**: P-SKU renewal notification, cost pressure, AI interest
- **Pain Points**: Cost justification, AI investment uncertainty
- **Decision Makers**: CIO, CTO, VP Data & Analytics, CFO

### Market Timing

- **Peak opportunity**: NOW through Q4 2025 (forced migration wave)
- **Forcing function**: All P-SKU customers must migrate by renewal after Feb 1, 2025
- **Competitive window**: Limited time before market moves to optimization phase

## Integration with Existing Services

### Application Rationalization Connection
- Same playbook: Eliminate waste → Fund modernization
- Data platform rationalization follows proven methodology
- Natural expansion from app rationalization engagements

### AI Shockwave Workshop Connection
- Power BI Copilot as first contained AI use case
- Fabric as platform foundation for broader AI strategy
- Migration as readiness forcing function

### Microsoft ECIF Program Connection
- Fabric capacity may be fundable through Azure commitments
- Strategic vehicle for larger Microsoft platform deals

## Key Strategic Decisions (Pending)

### 1. Primary Positioning
- [ ] Cost optimization focus?
- [ ] AI readiness focus?
- [ ] Hybrid "thread the needle" approach? ✓ (current hypothesis)

### 2. Engagement Model
- [ ] Quick assessment only (2-4 weeks)?
- [ ] Full migration + implementation (3-6 months)?
- [ ] Ongoing advisory (retained)?
- [ ] Phased approach (assessment → implementation → support)? ✓ (recommended)

### 3. Service Integration
- [ ] Standalone offering?
- [ ] Component of Application Rationalization?
- [ ] Separate but related offerings? ✓ (current hypothesis)

## Meeting Notes & Logs

*(Create dated meeting notes and conversation logs here as project progresses)*

## Key Insights & Learnings

1. **F64 is the strategic inflection point** - Economics fundamentally change (viewer costs disappear, AI unlocks)

2. **The tension IS the value prop** - Cost pressure vs. AI investment creates strategic dilemma clients need help resolving

3. **Migration is catalyst, not goal** - Use forced migration to fix underlying problems (sprawl, duplication, poor governance)

4. **Readiness matters more than features** - If data is a mess, AI just gives faster bad answers

5. **Limited time window** - 2025-2026 migration wave creates unique consulting opportunity
