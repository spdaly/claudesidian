## License Types at a Glance

### Per-User Licenses
- **Free**: View content on F64+ capacities
- **Pro**: $14/month (was $10) - Creators + viewers on <F64
- **PPU**: $22/month (was $20) - Premium features per user

### Capacity SKUs (F-SKUs)

**The F64 Inflection Point:**
- **< F64** (F2-F32): Viewers need Pro licenses
- **≥ F64**: Free license viewers allowed, Copilot enabled

**SKU Equivalencies:**
- P1 = F64 (~$8,410/month pay-as-you-go)
- P2 = F128
- P3 = F256
- P4 = F512
- P5 = F1024

**Billing:**
- Pay-as-you-go: Per-second, pause/scale
- Reserved (1-year): ~40% discount

---

## Strategic Context

**Forced Migration Deadline:**
- All P-SKU customers → F-SKUs at renewal after Feb 1, 2025
- New P-SKU purchases ended July 1, 2024
- **Peak consulting window: NOW through Q4 2025**

## Client Pain Points We Address

### 1. Cost Justification
"Costs are going up and we don't know if we can justify it"

**Real issues:**
- Over-provisioned capacity
- Duplicate/unused reports
- No usage visibility
- Hidden opportunity costs

### 2. AI Investment Uncertainty
"We want AI/Copilot but don't know if it's worth it"

**Real issues:**
- Data quality not ready for AI
- No clear use cases
- Skills gap
- Fear of shelfware

---

## Positioning Hypothesis

> **"We help you invest strategically in AI capabilities while simultaneously reducing waste in your data platform."**

**Why it works:**
- Addresses BOTH pain points (cost + AI)
- Uses Application Rationalization playbook
- Differentiates from license sellers and Big 4
- Creates higher-value engagement

---

## Key Decision Points for Clients

### F64 Break-Even Calculation
**When does F64 make sense vs. buying Pro licenses?**

Formula:
- F64 cost (~$8,410/month) ÷ Pro cost ($14/month) = ~600 users
- If < 600 viewers: Buy Pro licenses
- If > 600 viewers: Buy F64 capacity

**BUT:** This ignores AI/Copilot value (F64+ only)

### Reserved vs. Pay-As-You-Go
- **Reserved**: 40% savings, 1-year commitment, best for stable workloads
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Flexible, can pause, best for variable/dev workloads

---

## Competitive Differentiation

**We are NOT:**
- Microsoft partners (license sellers)
- Big 4 (expensive, over-engineered)
- Training companies (button-pushing)
- BI consultancies (tactical only)

**We ARE:**
- Strategic advisors on platform rationalization
- AI readiness assessors
- Cost optimization + strategic investment guides

---

## Integration with Service Portfolio

### Application Rationalization Connection
Same playbook: Eliminate waste → Fund modernization

### AI Shockwave Connection
Power BI Copilot = First contained AI use case

### ECIF Program Connection
Fabric capacity may be fundable through Azure consumption commitments

## Next Actions (Prioritized)

1. **Define ideal client profile** - Who's the perfect fit?
2. **Choose engagement model** - Assessment? Full migration? Advisory?
3. **Build assessment framework** - Usage analysis + rationalization methodology
4. **Create ROI calculator** - F-SKU sizing + break-even analysis
5. **Identify 3-5 pilot clients** - Test positioning with real opportunities

---

## Key Insights

1. **F64 is where economics change** (viewer costs disappear, AI unlocks)
2. **The tension IS the value prop** (cost vs. AI investment)
3. **Migration is the catalyst, not the goal** (fix underlying problems)
4. **There's a time window** (2025-2026 wave, then different market)
5. **Readiness matters more than features** (is data/org ready for AI?)
