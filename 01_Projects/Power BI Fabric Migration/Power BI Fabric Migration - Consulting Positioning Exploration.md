## Market Opportunity

### The Forcing Functions

**Regulatory/Mandatory**
- All P-SKU (Power BI Premium) customers must transition to F-SKUs at renewal after Feb 1, 2025
- New P-SKU purchases ended July 1, 2024
- This creates a **forced migration wave** through 2025-2026

**Economic Pressure**
- Power BI Pro licenses: $10/month → $14/month (+40% increase)
- Premium Per User (PPU): $20/month → $22/month (+10% increase)
- Existing investments being re-evaluated due to cost increases

**Feature Pull**
- AI/Copilot capabilities require F64+ capacity
- Broader Microsoft Fabric platform features (Data Factory, Data Engineering, Real-Time Intelligence)
- "Modern data platform" positioning from Microsoft

### Market Timing
- **NOW through Q4 2025**: Peak migration period
- **Consulting window**: Clients making decisions in next 12-18 months
- **Competition**: Microsoft partners, Big 4, niche Power BI consultancies

---

## Technical Foundation (License Types)

### Per-User Licenses
- **Free**: Basic Fabric access, can view content on F64+ capacities
- **Power BI Pro**: $14/month - Required for content creators and viewers on <F64 capacities
- **Premium Per User (PPU)**: $22/month - Premium features per individual

### Capacity-Based Licenses (F-SKUs)

**The F64 Threshold (Critical Strategic Decision Point)**
- **Below F64** (F2, F4, F8, F16, F32): Viewers need Pro licenses ($14/month each)
- **F64 and above**: Free license users can view content (no per-user viewer cost)
- **F64+ only**: Required for Copilot and advanced AI features

**SKU Equivalencies**
- Premium P1 = Fabric F64
- Premium P2 = Fabric F128
- Premium P3 = Fabric F256
- Premium P4 = Fabric F512
- Premium P5 = Fabric F1024

**Capacity Units vs vCores**
- Old model: vCores (virtual cores)
- New model: Capacity Units (CUs)
- Conversion: 1 vCore = 8 CUs

**Pricing Models**
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Per-second billing, can pause/scale (F64 ~$8,410/month in West US)
- **Reserved Instance**: 1-year commitment, ~40% savings, includes on-premises PBIRS rights

## Client Pain Points (Primary Focus)

### 1. Cost Justification Under Pressure
**"Our costs are going up and we don't know if we can justify it"**

**What This Really Means:**
- Need to justify budget increase to CFO/finance
- Uncertain if current investment is being fully utilized
- Fear of over-provisioning in new model
- Hidden question: "Are we getting value from what we already have?"

**Underlying Issues:**
- No visibility into actual usage vs. capacity purchased
- Duplicate/unused reports consuming resources
- Shadow IT costs not captured
- Opportunity costs of inefficient data practices

**Decision Framework Needed:**
- Right-size capacity based on actual usage patterns
- Quantify hidden costs (maintenance, duplication, poor decisions)
- Build business case that accounts for total cost, not just licenses
- Identify savings opportunities to fund new investments

### 2. AI/Copilot Investment Uncertainty
**"We want AI/Copilot but don't know if it's worth the investment"**

**What This Really Means:**
- Copilot requires F64+ (premium investment)
- Unclear what business value AI will deliver
- Concern about organizational readiness
- Fear of investing in shelfware

**Underlying Issues:**
- Data quality/governance not ready for AI
- Users lack skills to leverage AI effectively
- No clear use cases or success metrics defined
- AI is a "check the box" exercise vs. strategic capability

**Decision Framework Needed:**
- Define measurable outcomes for AI investment
- Assess organizational readiness (data, skills, processes)
- Identify specific use cases with ROI potential
- Create staged adoption path vs. all-or-nothing

### The Strategic Tension
**These two problems create opposing forces:**
- Cost pressure → Minimize spend, stay conservative
- AI opportunity → Premium investment, take risk

**This tension is where consulting value lives.** Clients need help threading the needle.

## Competitive Positioning

### Who We're NOT

**Microsoft Partners/Resellers**
- Focus: Sell licenses, basic migration support
- Weakness: Incentivized to maximize license sales, not optimize
- Differentiation needed: Independent strategic advice

**Big 4 Consulting**
- Focus: Enterprise-scale transformation, complex TCO models
- Weakness: Expensive, slow, over-engineered solutions
- Differentiation needed: Practical, actionable, right-sized approach

**Power BI Training Companies**
- Focus: Technical skills, feature training
- Weakness: Don't address strategic business questions
- Differentiation needed: Business strategy, not button-pushing

**Niche BI Consultancies**
- Focus: Implementation, report building, optimization
- Weakness: Tactical, don't connect to broader business strategy
- Differentiation needed: Enterprise architecture perspective

### Our Differentiation Hypotheses (To Validate)

**Option 1: Platform Rationalization Approach**
> "Power BI Fabric migration is an excuse to rationalize your entire data platform. We help you use the forced migration as a catalyst to eliminate waste, consolidate redundancy, and right-size investment."

**Option 2: Strategic AI Investment Approach**
> "We help you thread the needle between cost optimization and AI investment. Most companies see it as either/or. We find the savings in your existing platform to fund strategic AI capabilities."

**Option 3: AI Readiness Assessment Approach**
> "Before you invest in Copilot, we assess whether your organization is ready. We evaluate data quality, governance, skills, and use cases to ensure you get ROI, not shelfware."

## Integration with Existing Service Offerings

### Connection to Application Rationalization

**The Parallel Pattern:**
- App Rationalization: Eliminate redundant applications to fund modernization
- Data Platform Rationalization: Eliminate redundant reports/data to fund AI investment

**Potential Value Chain:**
1. Application rationalization reveals data integration challenges
2. Data platform assessment uncovers Power BI sprawl
3. Fabric migration becomes rationalization opportunity
4. Savings fund AI/Copilot strategic investments

**Question to Answer:** Is this a **standalone offering** or a **component** of Application Rationalization?

### Connection to AI Shockwave Workshop

## Emerging Positioning Hypothesis

### The "Thread the Needle" Approach

**Core Positioning:**
> "We help you invest strategically in AI capabilities while simultaneously reducing waste in your data platform. Most companies approach Fabric migration as a licensing decision. We approach it as a platform rationalization opportunity that funds AI investment through operational savings."

**Why This Works:**
1. **Addresses both pain points:** Cost pressure AND AI opportunity
2. **Differentiated from competition:** Not just license optimization or AI hype
3. **Leverages existing IP:** Application Rationalization playbook applied to data
4. **Creates multiple entry points:** Cost-focused or AI-focused clients both qualify
5. **Higher value engagement:** Strategic advisory, not tactical implementation

**The Client Journey:**
1. **Trigger:** Renewal notification, cost increase, AI interest
2. **Problem:** "We're being forced to change and costs are going up"
3. **Deeper problem:** "We don't know if we're getting value from what we have"
4. **Opportunity:** "We want AI but can't justify the investment"
5. **Solution:** "Rationalize the platform to fund the future"
6. **Outcome:** Right-sized Fabric deployment + AI roadmap + cost savings

## Key Insights / Aha Moments

1. **The tension IS the value prop**: Cost pressure vs. AI investment creates the strategic dilemma that clients need help resolving. Don't pick one side - help them navigate both.

2. **F64 is the strategic inflection point**: Not just a technical threshold, it's where economics fundamentally change (per-user costs disappear, AI becomes available). This is the key decision point for clients.

3. **Platform rationalization playbook applies**: The same approach used in Application Rationalization (eliminate waste to fund modernization) works for data platforms. This is familiar territory.

4. **Migration is the catalyst, not the goal**: The forced migration creates urgency, but the real value is in using it as an excuse to fix underlying problems (report sprawl, data duplication, poor governance).

5. **Readiness matters more than features**: Clients asking "is Copilot worth it?" are really asking "are we ready for AI?" If data is a mess, AI just gives faster bad answers.

6. **There's a time window**: 2025-2026 migration wave creates consulting opportunity. After that, market moves to optimization/adoption phase (different offering).
