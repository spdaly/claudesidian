## Opening: The AI Portfolio Paradox (Minutes 0-5)

"Let me start by acknowledging what's probably on your mind right now - AI.

Every vendor you talk to is pitching AI features. Your board is asking about your AI strategy. Your business stakeholders are asking when they can use AI in their processes.

And underneath all of that, you're thinking: **My application portfolio isn't ready for this.**

You're right. And here's why this matters more than most organizations realize:

### The AI Cost Multiplier Effect

Most enterprises have significant application redundancy. Not because anyone made bad decisions - but because of growth, acquisitions, decentralized purchasing, and evolving business needs over time.

When you layer AI features across a redundant portfolio, you don't just add cost - you multiply it.

**Real example:** One of our clients had:
- Five different CRM systems across business units
- Three collaboration platforms
- Four service desk tools

They calculated the cost of rolling out AI features across their current portfolio: **$4.2 million annually in new licensing costs.**

After rationalization: **$1.8 million** for the same AI capabilities.

**Same AI capabilities. $2.4 million less per year. Forever.**

That's the AI cost multiplier effect. Every redundant application becomes an AI tax.

### But Here's the Challenge

Traditional application rationalization takes 18-24 months. Your business stakeholders want AI capabilities now - not in two years.

So you're caught between:
- Responding to immediate AI pressure from stakeholders
- Knowing you need to rationalize before AI costs spiral
- Not having time to do comprehensive rationalization first

We've designed an approach that addresses both needs. But before I explain it, let me show you why this moment is different."

---

## Why Now: The Perfect Storm (Minutes 5-10)

"Three forces are converging right now that make this the right time - maybe the only time - to get rationalization done:

### Force 1: AI is Creating Burning Platform
For the first time in years, you have a burning platform that business stakeholders understand:

- **Your CFO cares** because AI licensing costs are showing up in budget forecasts
- **Your business leaders care** because competitors are talking about AI capabilities
- **Your board cares** because AI is in every analyst report and earnings call

This isn't an IT efficiency project anymore. It's a business imperative with executive attention.

### Force 2: SaaS Vendors are Forcing Your Hand
Your SaaS vendors are embedding AI features whether you want them or not:

- Salesforce Einstein pricing
- Microsoft Copilot bundling
- ServiceNow AI capabilities
- Every HR, finance, and collaboration platform adding AI premium tiers

You're going to pay for these features. The only question is: Will you pay across a bloated, redundant portfolio? Or an optimized one?

### Force 3: Budget Cycles Create Natural Window
Most organizations are in budget planning right now. That means:

- **You can quantify** the AI cost multiplier in next year's budget
- **You can show** the cost avoidance of rationalization
- **You can secure** multi-year funding when you have the business case

This window closes once budgets are set. Then you're locked into paying AI premiums across your current portfolio for another year.

### The Bottom Line

The stars have aligned:
- Executive attention (AI FOMO)
- Business case (cost multiplier)
- Timing (budget cycles)
- Proven methodology (Gartner TIME)

If you've been thinking about portfolio rationalization, this is your moment."

## Three Paths: Match Your Situation (Minutes 10-22)

"We work with three types of clients. Each has different needs, different constraints, and different buying patterns.

We've designed three distinct paths so you can start where it makes sense for your organization.

### PATH 1: AI Acceleration Sprint
**60-90 days | $75K-$150K investment**

#### Who This Is For
Organizations that need to respond to immediate AI pressure:
- Business stakeholders demanding AI capabilities now
- May not have budget or mandate for full transformation yet
- Need quick wins to satisfy FOMO and build momentum
- Want to understand what's possible before committing to comprehensive work

#### What You Get

**Phase 1: Rapid AI-Readiness Assessment** (2 weeks)
- Simplified TIME assessment focused on AI-blocking factors
- Vendor AI roadmap analysis for your key platforms
- Integration capability evaluation
- Platform modernity assessment

**Phase 2: Enable High-Value Capabilities** (4-6 weeks)
- Identify 1-2 AI capabilities with immediate business value
- Remove technical or architectural blockers
- Implement selected capabilities
- Measure business outcomes

**Phase 3: Strategic Roadmap** (2-3 weeks)
- Document what's possible with current portfolio
- Identify what's blocked by portfolio constraints
- Build business case for deeper rationalization
- Prioritized AI adoption roadmap

#### What Happens Next
Two equally valid outcomes:
- ✅ **Satisfied standalone:** You got wins, addressed FOMO, may return later for comprehensive work
- ➡️ **Natural progression:** Assessment revealed constraints that make the business case for Path 2

**Key principle:** This has complete value on its own. You're not buying phase one of something bigger - you're buying a complete, useful engagement.

---

### PATH 2: AI-Ready Portfolio Transformation
**18-24 months | $500K-$1.5M investment**

#### Who This Is For
Organizations ready for comprehensive rationalization:
- Clear executive mandate and sponsorship
- Past the FOMO phase, ready for deep work
- Committed to sustainable transformation
- Want to build long-term capability, not just quick fixes

#### What You Get

**Phase 1: Comprehensive Assessment** (8-12 weeks)
- Full TIME methodology assessment across entire portfolio
- AI-readiness overlay for every application
- Business process mapping and standardization opportunities
- Technical debt and architectural analysis
- Total cost of ownership modeling

**Phase 2: Rationalization Strategy** (8-12 weeks)
- Business process standardization roadmap (critical success factor)
- Application consolidation priorities and sequencing
- Governance model and decision frameworks
- Change management and communication plan
- Multi-year transformation roadmap

**Phase 3: Execution - Wave 1** (12-16 weeks)
- First round of strategic consolidations
- Application decommissioning ("undertaker" work)
- Quick wins for momentum and credibility
- Lessons learned and approach refinement

**Phase 4: Execution - Waves 2-3** (remaining duration)
- Subsequent consolidation waves
- Platform modernization where needed
- Continuous portfolio optimization
- Governance and intake process establishment

**Phase 5: Capability Build** (ongoing)
- Application Undertaker role training
- Portfolio management playbook
- Decision frameworks and tools
- Sustainable continuous improvement

#### What Happens Next
Measured, systematic transformation with quantified outcomes at each phase:
- **Months 1-6:** Assessment complete, quick wins delivering, ROI validated
- **Months 7-12:** First wave strategic consolidations, measurable savings, AI pilots enabled
- **Months 13-24:** Major consolidations complete, target savings achieved, modern architecture in place

---

### PATH 3: Accelerated Transformation Program
**21-27 months | $550K-$1.6M bundled investment**

#### Who This Is For
Organizations that need BOTH immediate wins AND comprehensive transformation:
- Facing AI pressure that can't wait 6 months for assessment
- Committed to full transformation but need Phase 0 for credibility
- Want integrated program, not two separate engagements
- Can secure budget for comprehensive work if Sprint proves value

#### What You Get

**Sprint Phase** (3 months) - Same as Path 1:
- Rapid AI-readiness assessment
- 1-2 high-value AI capabilities enabled
- Strategic roadmap and business case

**Integration Point** (2 weeks):
- Sprint learnings inform rationalization priorities
- Updated assessment based on Sprint discoveries
- Refined scope and approach for transformation
- Seamless handoff (same team continues)

**Transformation Phase** (18-24 months) - Same as Path 2:
- Full TIME assessment (accelerated by Sprint insights)
- Business process standardization
- Multi-wave rationalization execution
- Capability build and governance

#### What Makes This Different
- **Sprint insights** accelerate transformation planning (know where quick wins are)
- **Integrated team** means no re-learning or handoffs
- **Bundle pricing** provides incentive vs. buying Path 1 then Path 2 separately
- **Momentum** from Sprint wins builds support for transformation work

#### What Happens Next
Quick wins build credibility for the comprehensive work that follows. Business stakeholders see AI capabilities enabled while IT builds foundation for sustainable transformation.

**[PAUSE POINT]**

Before I continue - which of these paths resonates with your situation right now?"

## What Success Looks Like (Minutes 22-27)

"Let me be specific about what outcomes you can expect:

### Quantified Results
These numbers are from Gartner data - 143 consulting engagements, 24,000+ applications assessed:

- **Cost Reduction:** 15-30% of portfolio operating costs
- **AI Cost Avoidance:** 20-40% of AI licensing costs (this is net new value)
- **Complexity Reduction:** 30-50% fewer applications
- **Agility Improvement:** 40%+ faster time to implement changes
- **Risk Mitigation:** Reduced security surface, better compliance, skills risk management

### Real Case Example
$300M revenue manufacturing client, $50M application portfolio:

**Starting State:**
- 600 applications (212 "elephants" = 82% of budget)
- Heavy redundancy in CRM, ERP, service desk, collaboration
- High technical debt, skills risk, integration complexity

**Outcomes:**
- **$12M annual cost reduction** (24% of $50M portfolio)
- **$3.8M AI cost avoidance** (annual, based on vendor pricing for AI features)
- **Portfolio reduced 30%** (600 → 420 applications)
- **ROI: 3.2x over three years** (investment: $4.8M, benefits: $15.4M)

**Timeline:**
- Months 1-6: Assessment, quick wins, $2M in savings
- Months 7-12: First consolidation wave, AI pilots, $6M cumulative savings
- Months 13-24: Remaining consolidations, $12M run-rate savings achieved

### Three Things to Remember

**1. This isn't about reducing application count**

The goal isn't fewer applications. It's eliminating cost, complexity, and risk from the <20% of applications that consume >80% of your budget.

You have exactly the right number of applications today to run the business the way you run the business today. If you want fewer applications, you need to standardize business processes first.

**2. No rationalization without business process standardization**

IT-led rationalization programs fail. This must be business-led with IT as enabler. If your business units insist on running processes differently, they'll need different applications.

Executive sponsorship from CEO/CFO/COO level is critical for process standardization.

**3. This is proven methodology, not experimentation**

- Gartner TIME framework: Two decades, 143 engagements, 24,000+ applications
- Seven-step rationalization process: Validated across industries
- AI-readiness overlay: Builds on proven foundation

We're not making this up. We're applying what works and adapting it for AI enablement."

## Next Steps: How We Begin (Minutes 27-30)

"Here's what happens next for each path:

### If Path 1 Appeals to You:
1. **Discovery call** (1 hour) - Understand AI pressure points and quick win opportunities
2. **Scoping session** (2 hours) - Identify 1-2 high-value targets, assess feasibility
3. **Proposal** within one week with specific deliverables and timeline
4. **Start within 2-3 weeks** (we can move fast on this)

### If Path 2 Appeals to You:
1. **Executive alignment session** (2 hours) - Scope, sponsorship, success criteria
2. **Initial portfolio assessment** (1 week) - Current state snapshot to inform proposal
3. **Detailed proposal** within two weeks with multi-phase plan
4. **Kickoff within 4-6 weeks** with full team mobilization

### If Path 3 Appeals to You:
1. **Combined discovery** (3 hours) - AI needs + transformation readiness + executive sponsorship
2. **Integrated planning session** (half day) - Sprint targets + full program scope
3. **Comprehensive proposal** within two weeks with integrated timeline
4. **Sprint starts within 2-3 weeks** with transformation phase planned

### The First Conversation

Before we can propose anything, we need to understand:

1. **What's driving this right now?**
   - Business stakeholder AI pressure?
   - Infrastructure cost concerns?
   - Board/executive mandate?
   - Budget cycle timing?

2. **What's your current state?**
   - Approximate portfolio size?
   - Known redundancy areas?
   - Recent assessments or inventory work?
   - Current governance maturity?

3. **What's your constraint?**
   - Time? (Need quick wins)
   - Budget? (Need to prove ROI first)
   - Sponsorship? (Need executive alignment)
   - Capacity? (Need us to drive, not just advise)

That 1-3 hour discovery conversation will tell us which path makes sense and what the right starting point is.

### What To Expect From Us

- **Proposal within 1-2 weeks** of discovery conversation
- **Fixed-fee pricing** (not time and materials - we own the outcomes)
- **Specific deliverables** with acceptance criteria
- **Transparent methodology** (you'll see our playbook)
- **Dedicated team** (not part-time or remote-only)

What questions do you have?"
