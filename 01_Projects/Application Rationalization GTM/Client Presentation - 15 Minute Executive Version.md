## Opening: The AI Cost Multiplier (Minutes 0-3)

"Let me start with what's probably on your mind - AI.

Every vendor is pitching AI features. Your board is asking about your AI strategy. And here's what nobody's telling you:

**Your application portfolio isn't ready for it.**

Most enterprises have significant application redundancy. Not because of poor decisions - but because of growth, acquisitions, and evolving business needs.

When you layer AI features across a redundant portfolio, you multiply the costs:

**Quick example:** One client had five CRM systems, three collaboration platforms, four service desk tools. Rolling out AI features across current portfolio: $4.2 million annually. After rationalization: $1.8 million. **Same AI capabilities, $2.4 million less per year.**

That's the AI cost multiplier effect.

But here's the challenge: Traditional rationalization takes 18-24 months. Your business stakeholders want AI responses now.

We've designed an approach that addresses both needs."

## Three Paths: Match Your Situation (Minutes 3-10)

"We work with three types of clients, and we've structured three distinct paths:

### PATH 1: AI Acceleration Sprint
**60-90 days | $75K-$150K**

For organizations that need to respond to immediate AI pressure.

**You get:**
- Rapid AI-readiness assessment of your portfolio
- 1-2 high-value AI capabilities enabled
- Clear roadmap showing what's possible and what's blocked
- Business case for deeper rationalization if needed

**This works if:** You need quick wins to satisfy stakeholder FOMO, may not have budget for full transformation yet.

**What happens next:** Either you're satisfied with the wins, or the assessment reveals constraints that make the business case for comprehensive work.

---

### PATH 2: AI-Ready Portfolio Transformation
**18-24 months | $500K-$1.5M**

For organizations ready for comprehensive rationalization with clear executive mandate.

**You get:**
- Full portfolio assessment using proven TIME methodology
- Business process standardization roadmap
- Complete 7-step rationalization execution
- Application decommissioning capability
- Sustainable governance framework

**This works if:** You're past the FOMO phase, have executive sponsorship, and are ready for strategic transformation.

**What happens next:** Measured, systematic transformation with quantified outcomes at each phase.

---

### PATH 3: Accelerated Transformation Program
**21-27 months | $550K-$1.6M (bundled pricing)**

For organizations that need both immediate wins AND comprehensive transformation.

**You get:**
- 3-month Sprint phase for quick wins and momentum
- Sprint insights accelerate the transformation planning
- Seamless handoff to full program
- Bundle pricing with incentive vs. separate purchases

**This works if:** You need to respond to AI pressure now while building foundation for sustainable transformation.

**What happens next:** Quick wins build credibility for the comprehensive work that follows.

**[PAUSE POINT]**

Before I continue - which of these resonates with your situation?"

## Expected Outcomes: What Success Looks Like (Minutes 10-13)

"Regardless of which path, here's what you can expect:

### Quantified Results
Based on Gartner data from 143 consulting engagements:

- **Cost Reduction:** 15-30% of portfolio operating costs
- **AI Cost Avoidance:** 20-40% of AI licensing costs
- **Complexity Reduction:** 30-50% fewer applications
- **Agility Improvement:** 40%+ faster time to implement changes
- **Risk Mitigation:** Reduced security surface, compliance improvements

### Real Example
$300M revenue manufacturing client, $50M application portfolio:

- **$12M annual cost reduction** (24% of portfolio costs)
- **$3.8M AI cost avoidance** annually
- **Portfolio reduced 30%** (600 â†’ 420 applications)
- **ROI: 3.2x over three years**

### Timeline to Value
- **Months 1-6:** Assessment complete, quick wins delivering, ROI validated
- **Months 7-12:** First strategic consolidations, measurable savings, AI pilots enabled
- **Months 13-24:** Major consolidations complete, target savings achieved

The key insight: This isn't about reducing application count. It's about eliminating cost, complexity, and risk while enabling AI adoption."

## Next Steps: How We Begin (Minutes 13-15)

"Here's what happens next, depending on your path:

### If Path 1 Appeals to You:
1. **Discovery call** (1 hour) - Understand AI pressure points
2. **Scoping session** (2 hours) - Identify 1-2 high-value targets
3. **Proposal** within one week
4. **Start within 2-3 weeks**

### If Path 2 Appeals to You:
1. **Executive alignment session** (2 hours) - Scope and sponsorship
2. **Initial portfolio assessment** (1 week) - Current state snapshot
3. **Detailed proposal** within two weeks
4. **Kickoff within 4-6 weeks**

### If Path 3 Appeals to You:
1. **Combined discovery** (3 hours) - AI needs + transformation readiness
2. **Integrated planning session** (half day) - Sprint targets + program scope
3. **Comprehensive proposal** within two weeks
4. **Sprint starts within 2-3 weeks**

### The First Question
The first thing we need to understand is: What's driving this conversation right now?

Is it:
- Business stakeholder pressure around AI?
- Infrastructure and operations cost concerns?
- Board or executive mandate for portfolio optimization?
- Upcoming budget cycle creating urgency?

That will help us determine the right path and the right starting point."

## Closing

"Three things to remember:

1. **This isn't just cost cutting.** It's about making your portfolio AI-ready while reducing cost, complexity, and risk.

2. **You don't have to choose transformation or AI response.** Our three paths let you match your actual situation and constraints.

3. **This is proven methodology.** Gartner TIME framework, 143 engagements, 24,000+ applications assessed over two decades. We're not experimenting - we're applying what works.

What questions do you have?"
