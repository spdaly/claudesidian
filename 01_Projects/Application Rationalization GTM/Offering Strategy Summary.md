# Application Rationalization GTM - Offering Strategy Summary

## Core Positioning

**Value Proposition:** Traditional application rationalization that ENABLES future AI adoption

**Key Insight:** Enterprises need to respond to AI pressure NOW while also setting foundation for sustainable transformation. Cannot wait 2+ years to rationalize before adopting AI, but also cannot afford to layer AI on bloated portfolios.

## Target Market

**Primary Buyers:**
- CIOs/CTOs under pressure to respond to business stakeholder AI demands
- IT leaders managing infrastructure and operations cost pressures
- Enterprises recognizing AI will multiply costs across redundant applications

**Market Drivers:**
- AI features being embedded in applications with premium pricing
- Business stakeholder FOMO (real or imagined) about AI adoption
- SaaS vendors aggressively adding AI capabilities
- Need to rationalize portfolio economics BEFORE scaling AI adoption

## Three Client Buying Patterns

### Type A: "Fast Track Only" Clients
- **Need:** Respond to immediate AI pressure
- **Situation:** May not have budget/mandate for full transformation yet
- **Buying:** Quick wins, proof points, FOMO relief
- **May:** Come back later for full program (or might not)

### Type B: "Full Program with Fast Track Entry" Clients
- **Need:** Comprehensive transformation with quick wins for momentum
- **Situation:** Committed to transformation but need Phase 0 for credibility
- **Buying:** Full program with accelerated start
- **Ideal:** Most aligned with preferred engagement model

### Type C: "Skip Fast Track, Go Deep" Clients
- **Need:** Comprehensive rationalization with clear mandate
- **Situation:** Past FOMO phase, ready for deep work
- **Buying:** Traditional consulting engagement
- **Direct:** Enter full program without sprint phase

## Strategic Decision

**Approach:** Design offering to MATCH current buying behavior (not shape it)
- All three paths equally legitimate
- Optimize each path for its buyer
- Reduce friction to start
- Create natural progressions without forcing them

## Three-Path Offering Structure

### PATH 1: AI Acceleration Sprint
**Duration:** 60-90 days
**Investment:** $75K-$150K
**Target:** Type A Clients

**Deliverables:**
- Rapid AI-readiness assessment (simplified TIME)
- 1-2 high-value AI capabilities enabled
- AI roadmap showing what's possible/blocked
- Business case for deeper rationalization

**Exit Points:**
- ✅ Satisfied standalone (client got wins, may return later)
- ➡️ Natural progression to Path 2 (portfolio constraints revealed)

**Pricing Philosophy:** Standalone value - complete engagement, useful without continuation

---

### PATH 2: AI-Ready Portfolio Transformation
**Duration:** 18-24 months
**Investment:** $500K-$1.5M
**Target:** Type C Clients

**Deliverables:**
- Full TIME assessment with AI-readiness overlay
- Business process standardization roadmap
- 7-step rationalization execution
- Application undertaker capability build
- Continuous modernization framework

**Entry:** Can start directly without Sprint (includes comprehensive discovery)

**Pricing Philosophy:** Strategic engagement, substantial investment, multi-phase commitment

---

### PATH 3: Accelerated Transformation Program
**Duration:** 21-27 months (3-month Sprint + 18-24 month Transformation)
**Investment:** $550K-$1.6M (bundled pricing)
**Target:** Type B Clients

**Structure:**
- Sprint phase: Immediate wins and momentum
- Sprint insights: Accelerate transformation planning
- Seamless handoff: Integrated program, not two separate engagements

**Integration Benefit:** Sprint learnings inform rationalization priorities

**Pricing Philosophy:** Bundle pricing with incentive vs. separate purchases

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Quantified Results (Based on Gartner data)
- **Cost Reduction:** 15-30% portfolio operating costs
- **AI Cost Avoidance:** 20-40% of AI licensing costs
- **Complexity Reduction:** 30-50% fewer applications
- **Agility Improvement:** 40%+ faster time to implement changes
- **Risk Mitigation:** Reduced security surface, compliance improvements

### Timeline to Value
- **Months 1-6:** Assessment complete, quick wins delivering, ROI validated
- **Months 7-12:** First wave strategic consolidations, measurable savings, AI pilots enabled
- **Months 13-24:** Major consolidations complete, target savings achieved, modern architecture in place

### Case Example Metrics
- $12M annual cost reduction (24% of $50M portfolio)
- $3.8M AI cost avoidance annually
- Portfolio reduced 30% (600 → 420 applications)
- ROI: 3.2x over three years

---

## Methodology Foundation

**Based On:** Gartner TIME methodology
- 143 consulting engagements
- 24,000+ applications assessed
- Proven over two decades

**Enhanced With:** AI-readiness assessment overlay
- Platform modernity evaluation
- Vendor AI roadmap analysis
- Integration capability assessment
- AI enablement blocking factors

**Key Insight from Research:**
> "No rationalization without process standardization"

IT-led rationalization programs fail. This must be business-led initiative with IT as enabler.

---

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Business Sponsorship:** Executive-level (CEO/CFO/COO) support for process standardization
2. **Focus on "Elephants":** <20% of apps = >80% of budget (not about reducing app count)
3. **Iterative Execution:** Cycles of inventory → assess → rationalize
4. **Governance Reform:** Prevent "one step forward, two steps backward"
5. **Application Undertaker:** Systematic decommissioning capability

---

## Competitive Differentiation

**Not just traditional APM consulting:**
- Explicit AI-readiness as outcome
- Fast track option for FOMO response
- Three flexible entry points

**Not just AI consulting:**
- Grounded in proven rationalization methodology
- Addresses portfolio economics, not just AI features
- Sustainable transformation, not just quick pilots

**Unique Position:**
- Bridge between cost reduction (traditional rationalization) and AI enablement (future-focused)
- Respond to immediate pressure while building foundation
- Business process thinking + AI value realization

---

## Open Questions / Next Steps

### Still to Define:
- Specific pricing models for each path
- Qualification criteria (avoiding tire-kickers on Path 1)
- Deliverable templates and methodologies
- Case studies and reference stories
- Tool/partner ecosystem requirements
- Sales enablement and go-to-market approach

### Materials to Build:
- Client presentation deck
- Path-specific one-pagers
- Discovery questionnaire
- Proposal templates
- ROI calculators
- Assessment frameworks
