## Opening: The AI Portfolio Paradox (Minutes 0-5)

"Let me start by acknowledging what's probably on your mind right now - AI.

Every vendor you talk to is pitching AI features. Your board is asking about your AI strategy. Your business stakeholders are asking when they can use AI in their processes.

And underneath all of that, you're thinking: **My application portfolio isn't ready for this.**

You're right. And here's why this matters more than most organizations realize:

### The AI Cost Multiplier Effect

Most enterprises have significant application redundancy. Not because anyone made bad decisions - but because of growth, acquisitions, decentralized purchasing, and evolving business needs over time.

When you layer AI features across a redundant portfolio, you don't just add cost - you multiply it.

**Real example:** One of our clients had:
- Five different CRM systems across business units
- Three collaboration platforms
- Four service desk tools

They calculated the cost of rolling out AI features across their current portfolio: **$4.2 million annually in new licensing costs.**

After rationalization: **$1.8 million** for the same AI capabilities.

**Same AI capabilities. $2.4 million less per year. Forever.**

That's the AI cost multiplier effect. Every redundant application becomes an AI tax.

### But Here's the Challenge

Traditional application rationalization takes 18-24 months. Your business stakeholders want AI capabilities now - not in two years.

So you're caught between:
- Responding to immediate AI pressure from stakeholders
- Knowing you need to rationalize before AI costs spiral
- Not having time to do comprehensive rationalization first

We've designed an approach that addresses both needs. But before I explain it, I want to understand your specific situation better."

---

## Why Now: The Perfect Storm (Minutes 5-15)

"Three forces are converging right now that make this the right time - maybe the only time - to get rationalization done:

### Force 1: AI is Creating Burning Platform
For the first time in years, you have a burning platform that business stakeholders understand:

- **Your CFO cares** because AI licensing costs are showing up in budget forecasts
- **Your business leaders care** because competitors are talking about AI capabilities
- **Your board cares** because AI is in every analyst report and earnings call

This isn't an IT efficiency project anymore. It's a business imperative with executive attention.

### Force 2: SaaS Vendors are Forcing Your Hand
Your SaaS vendors are embedding AI features whether you want them or not:

- Salesforce Einstein pricing
- Microsoft Copilot bundling
- ServiceNow AI capabilities
- Every HR, finance, and collaboration platform adding AI premium tiers

You're going to pay for these features. The only question is: Will you pay across a bloated, redundant portfolio? Or an optimized one?

### Force 3: Budget Cycles Create Natural Window
Most organizations are in budget planning right now. That means:

- **You can quantify** the AI cost multiplier in next year's budget
- **You can show** the cost avoidance of rationalization
- **You can secure** multi-year funding when you have the business case

This window closes once budgets are set. Then you're locked into paying AI premiums across your current portfolio for another year.

---

### **[INTERACTIVE EXERCISE 1]** (5 minutes)

"Let's make this specific to your organization. I'd like each of you to think about:

**Question 1:** What's one area where you know you have application redundancy?
- Different business units using different tools for same function?
- Legacy and new systems running in parallel?
- Acquisitions that brought duplicate capabilities?

**Question 2:** Where is AI pressure coming from in your organization?
- Board/executive questions?
- Competitor capabilities?
- Vendor pitches?
- Business stakeholder requests?

**Question 3:** What's your budget planning timeline?
- When do budgets need to be finalized?
- Is AI cost already in budget discussions?
- What budget pressures exist right now?

Let's hear from a few of you..."

**[Facilitate discussion - capture responses on whiteboard/virtual board]**

**[Transition]:** "This is exactly the pattern we see. You have known redundancy, mounting AI pressure, and a budget window. Let me show you three ways organizations are responding..."

---

## Three Paths: Match Your Situation (Minutes 15-35)

"We work with three types of clients. Each has different needs, different constraints, and different buying patterns.

I'm going to explain all three paths in detail, and then we'll have an exercise to help you identify which resonates with your situation.

### PATH 1: AI Acceleration Sprint
**60-90 days | $75K-$150K investment**

#### Who This Is For
Organizations that need to respond to immediate AI pressure:
- Business stakeholders demanding AI capabilities now
- May not have budget or mandate for full transformation yet
- Need quick wins to satisfy FOMO and build momentum
- Want to understand what's possible before committing to comprehensive work

Think of this as: **"We need to respond to AI pressure NOW and figure out the bigger plan later."**

#### What You Get

**Phase 1: Rapid AI-Readiness Assessment** (2 weeks)
- Simplified TIME assessment focused on AI-blocking factors
- Vendor AI roadmap analysis for your key platforms
- Integration capability evaluation
- Platform modernity assessment

We're not assessing your entire portfolio - just enough to understand what's enabling vs. blocking AI adoption.

**Phase 2: Enable High-Value Capabilities** (4-6 weeks)
- Identify 1-2 AI capabilities with immediate business value
- Remove technical or architectural blockers
- Implement selected capabilities
- Measure business outcomes

This is actual delivery - not just planning. You'll have AI capabilities running in production.

**Phase 3: Strategic Roadmap** (2-3 weeks)
- Document what's possible with current portfolio
- Identify what's blocked by portfolio constraints
- Build business case for deeper rationalization
- Prioritized AI adoption roadmap

This is where we're honest: "Here's what you can do now. Here's what's blocked. Here's what fixing those blocks would cost and save."

#### What Happens Next
Two equally valid outcomes:
- ✅ **Satisfied standalone:** You got wins, addressed FOMO, may return later for comprehensive work
- ➡️ **Natural progression:** Assessment revealed constraints that make the business case for Path 2

**Key principle:** This has complete value on its own. You're not buying phase one of something bigger - you're buying a complete, useful engagement.

#### Who Typically Chooses This
- Organizations responding to board/executive AI questions
- IT leaders who need to prove ROI before asking for transformation budget
- Companies in fast-moving industries where "wait 18 months" isn't viable
- Organizations with limited consulting budget but real AI pressure

---

### PATH 2: AI-Ready Portfolio Transformation
**18-24 months | $500K-$1.5M investment**

#### Who This Is For
Organizations ready for comprehensive rationalization:
- Clear executive mandate and sponsorship
- Past the FOMO phase, ready for deep work
- Committed to sustainable transformation
- Want to build long-term capability, not just quick fixes

Think of this as: **"We know we need to rationalize. Let's do it right and build foundation for AI."**

#### What You Get

**Phase 1: Comprehensive Assessment** (8-12 weeks)
- Full TIME methodology assessment across entire portfolio
- AI-readiness overlay for every application
- Business process mapping and standardization opportunities
- Technical debt and architectural analysis
- Total cost of ownership modeling

This is the deep work. Every application gets evaluated on multiple dimensions:
- Technical fitness (T) - platform, architecture, technical debt
- Investment profile (I) - cost to operate, cost to change
- Market alternatives (M) - could COTS/SaaS replace this?
- Elimination potential (E) - is this even needed?
- PLUS: AI-readiness assessment for each

**Phase 2: Rationalization Strategy** (8-12 weeks)
- Business process standardization roadmap (critical success factor)
- Application consolidation priorities and sequencing
- Governance model and decision frameworks
- Change management and communication plan
- Multi-year transformation roadmap

This is where we get real about business processes. If you want to consolidate five CRM systems, someone has to decide on ONE sales process. That's business leadership work, not IT work.

**Phase 3: Execution - Wave 1** (12-16 weeks)
- First round of strategic consolidations
- Application decommissioning ("undertaker" work)
- Quick wins for momentum and credibility
- Lessons learned and approach refinement

We start with applications that have:
- High cost/complexity impact
- Clear business case
- Manageable risk
- Fast time to value

**Phase 4: Execution - Waves 2-3** (remaining duration)
- Subsequent consolidation waves
- Platform modernization where needed
- Continuous portfolio optimization
- Governance and intake process establishment

Each wave builds on lessons from previous waves. We're learning and adapting throughout.

**Phase 5: Capability Build** (ongoing)
- Application Undertaker role training
- Portfolio management playbook
- Decision frameworks and tools
- Sustainable continuous improvement

The goal isn't just to rationalize once - it's to build capability so you don't end up back here in five years.

#### What Happens Next
Measured, systematic transformation with quantified outcomes at each phase:
- **Months 1-6:** Assessment complete, quick wins delivering, ROI validated
- **Months 7-12:** First wave strategic consolidations, measurable savings, AI pilots enabled
- **Months 13-24:** Major consolidations complete, target savings achieved, modern architecture in place

#### Who Typically Chooses This
- Organizations with executive sponsorship for transformation
- Companies that have tried and failed at rationalization before (want to do it right this time)
- Enterprises with mature PMO and change management capabilities
- CIOs with multi-year mandate and budget

---

### PATH 3: Accelerated Transformation Program
**21-27 months | $550K-$1.6M bundled investment**

#### Who This Is For
Organizations that need BOTH immediate wins AND comprehensive transformation:
- Facing AI pressure that can't wait 6 months for assessment
- Committed to full transformation but need Phase 0 for credibility
- Want integrated program, not two separate engagements
- Can secure budget for comprehensive work if Sprint proves value

Think of this as: **"We need quick wins for credibility AND sustainable transformation."**

#### What You Get

**Sprint Phase** (3 months) - Same as Path 1:
- Rapid AI-readiness assessment
- 1-2 high-value AI capabilities enabled
- Strategic roadmap and business case

But here's what's different: We're doing this Sprint with an eye toward the transformation that follows. We're learning about your organization, building relationships, proving our approach.

**Integration Point** (2 weeks):
- Sprint learnings inform rationalization priorities
- Updated assessment based on Sprint discoveries
- Refined scope and approach for transformation
- Seamless handoff (same team continues)

There's no "meet the new team" moment. The people who did your Sprint continue into transformation. They already know your organization, your politics, your constraints.

**Transformation Phase** (18-24 months) - Same as Path 2:
- Full TIME assessment (accelerated by Sprint insights)
- Business process standardization
- Multi-wave rationalization execution
- Capability build and governance

But this transformation is faster because:
- We already understand where the quick wins are
- We've built relationships with stakeholders
- We've proven our methodology works in your environment
- We know your organizational dynamics

#### What Makes This Different
- **Sprint insights** accelerate transformation planning (know where quick wins are)
- **Integrated team** means no re-learning or handoffs
- **Bundle pricing** provides incentive vs. buying Path 1 then Path 2 separately
- **Momentum** from Sprint wins builds support for transformation work

#### What Happens Next
Quick wins build credibility for the comprehensive work that follows. Business stakeholders see AI capabilities enabled while IT builds foundation for sustainable transformation.

#### Who Typically Chooses This
- Organizations with significant AI pressure but also committed to transformation
- CIOs who need quick wins to maintain executive support for longer program
- Companies where "wait 6 months for assessment" will lose stakeholder patience
- Enterprises that want to test methodology before full commitment

---

### **[INTERACTIVE EXERCISE 2]** (5 minutes)

"Now I want you to do a quick self-assessment. Look at these three statements:

**Statement A:** "We need to respond to AI pressure NOW. We may not have budget/mandate for full transformation yet, but we need to show progress."

**Statement B:** "We're ready for comprehensive transformation. We have executive sponsorship, budget, and mandate. We want to do this right."

**Statement C:** "We need quick wins to build momentum AND we're committed to full transformation. We want both but can't wait 6 months to start showing value."

**Question:** Which statement best describes your situation?

Show of hands:
- How many resonate with Statement A? [Path 1]
- How many with Statement B? [Path 2]
- How many with Statement C? [Path 3]

**[Capture distribution - may reveal need for multiple tracks or paths]**

Let's talk about what you're seeing in your organization..."

## How We Work: Methodology and Team Structure (Minutes 35-45)

"Let me show you exactly how we work, regardless of which path you choose:

### The Gartner TIME Framework

Our foundation is Gartner's TIME methodology - proven across two decades, 143 consulting engagements, 24,000+ applications assessed.

**TIME stands for:**

**T - Technical Fitness**
- Platform health and modernity
- Technical debt levels
- Architecture quality
- Skills availability

**I - Investment Profile**
- Total cost of ownership
- Cost to operate vs. business value
- Cost and risk of making changes
- Resource consumption

**M - Market Alternatives**
- Could COTS or SaaS replace this?
- What would replacement cost?
- What's the risk of staying?
- Vendor roadmaps and AI capabilities

**E - Elimination Potential**
- Is this application even needed?
- Could we run the business without it?
- What's the decommissioning cost?
- What's keeping it alive?

Every application gets scored on these dimensions. This creates four quadrants:

1. **Tolerate** (low fitness, low investment) - Keep but don't invest
2. **Invest** (high fitness, high value) - Modernize and enhance
3. **Migrate** (low fitness, high importance) - Replace or re-platform
4. **Eliminate** (low value) - Decommission

### Our AI-Readiness Overlay

We add to TIME framework:
- Platform modernity for AI integration
- Vendor AI roadmap analysis
- Integration capability assessment
- AI enablement blocking factors
- Cost multiplier impact calculation

### Team Structure - Your Side and Our Side

**Your Side (required roles):**

**Executive Sponsor** (CIO, CFO, or COO level)
- Drives business process standardization decisions
- Removes organizational roadblocks
- Holds business units accountable
- Secures funding and resources

**Program Manager**
- Day-to-day coordination
- Schedule and deliverable management
- Risk and issue tracking
- Stakeholder communication

**Business Application Owners**
- Subject matter expertise on applications
- Business process knowledge
- User community relationships
- Change impact assessment

**Enterprise Architect**
- Technical standards and patterns
- Integration architecture
- Platform strategy
- Technical debt assessment

**Business Unit Leaders** (VP Sales, Operations, Finance, etc.)
- Business process ownership
- Standardization decisions
- User change management
- Value realization accountability

**Our Side (dedicated team):**

**Engagement Leader**
- Overall program responsibility
- Executive stakeholder management
- Strategic guidance and course correction
- Escalation point

**Portfolio Assessment Lead**
- TIME methodology expertise
- Assessment facilitation and analysis
- Rationalization recommendations
- Decision framework application

**Rationalization Execution Lead**
- Wave planning and execution
- Consolidation project management
- Risk mitigation
- Delivery accountability

**Application Undertaker Specialist**
- Decommissioning methodology
- Data migration and archival
- Dependency management
- Closure verification

### Governance Model

**Weekly Working Sessions**
- Team collaboration
- Analysis and decision-making
- Issue resolution
- Progress tracking

**Bi-Weekly Steering Committee**
- Executive updates
- Major decision points
- Resource needs
- Risk management

**Monthly Business Reviews**
- Value realization tracking
- Budget and timeline status
- Lessons learned
- Approach adjustments

### Critical Success Factors

Let me be direct about what makes this work:

**1. Business Sponsorship at Right Level**
This cannot be IT-only initiative. You need CEO/CFO/COO level support for business process standardization.

If VP of Sales says "my team needs OUR CRM because our process is special," someone has to be able to say "no, we're standardizing on one sales process."

**2. Focus on 'Elephants' Not 'Mice'**
< 20% of your applications consume > 80% of your budget.

Success isn't measured by application count reduction. It's measured by cost, complexity, and risk reduction.

**3. Iterative Execution**
We don't assess everything then do everything. We iterate: assess wave → rationalize wave → assess next wave.

This lets us learn and adapt. First wave is always messier than third wave.

**4. Governance Reform**
Without governance changes, you'll rationalize 30% of portfolio and then add 30% back in three years.

New applications need business case, architectural review, and "buy vs. build vs. reuse" analysis.

**5. Build Application Undertaker Capability**
Most organizations don't know how to decommission applications safely.

We train your team on systematic decommissioning: data migration, dependency management, archival, verification.

---

### **[Q&A BREAK]** (5 minutes)

"Before we move to outcomes, let's pause for questions about methodology or team structure.

Common questions we get:
- How much time does our team need to commit?
- Do you need to be onsite or can this be remote?
- How do you handle resistance from business units?
- What if we discover more problems than we have budget to fix?

What questions do you have?"

---

## What Success Looks Like (Minutes 45-52)

"Let me be specific about what outcomes you can expect:

### Quantified Results
These numbers are from Gartner data - 143 consulting engagements, 24,000+ applications assessed:

- **Cost Reduction:** 15-30% of portfolio operating costs
- **AI Cost Avoidance:** 20-40% of AI licensing costs (this is net new value)
- **Complexity Reduction:** 30-50% fewer applications
- **Agility Improvement:** 40%+ faster time to implement changes
- **Risk Mitigation:** Reduced security surface, better compliance, skills risk management

### Real Case Example
$300M revenue manufacturing client, $50M application portfolio:

**Starting State:**
- 600 applications total
- 212 "elephant" applications consuming 82% of budget
- Heavy redundancy: 5 CRMs, 4 ERPs, 3 service desk platforms
- High technical debt, skills risk, integration complexity
- Board pressure on AI capabilities

**Program Approach:**
- 24-month transformation (Path 2 model)
- Executive sponsor: COO (critical for process standardization)
- 6 rationalization waves
- 3 major platform consolidations

**Outcomes:**
- **$12M annual cost reduction** (24% of $50M portfolio)
  - $6M from application decommissioning
  - $4M from platform consolidation
  - $2M from process automation

- **$3.8M AI cost avoidance** (annual)
  - Calculated based on vendor AI feature pricing
  - Avoided across eliminated redundancy
  - Net new value not in original business case

- **Portfolio reduced 30%** (600 → 420 applications)
  - But "elephants" reduced 40% (212 → 127)
  - That's where the cost savings came from

- **ROI: 3.2x over three years**
  - Total investment: $4.8M (program cost + internal resources)
  - Three-year benefits: $15.4M (cost reduction + AI avoidance)
  - Payback period: 14 months

**Timeline:**
- **Months 1-6:** Assessment complete, quick wins delivering, $2M in savings
- **Months 7-12:** First consolidation wave, AI pilots enabled, $6M cumulative savings
- **Months 13-18:** Second consolidation wave, process standardization taking hold
- **Months 19-24:** Final wave, $12M run-rate savings achieved, governance established

**Key Success Factors:**
- COO sponsorship enabled process standardization
- CFO tracked value realization monthly
- Business unit leaders held accountable for adoption
- IT focused on technical execution, not business decisions

### What Made This Work

Three things were critical:

**1. Right Sponsorship**
COO owned business process decisions. When business units resisted standardization, COO made the call.

**2. Value Tracking**
CFO tracked savings monthly. Every consolidation had to show ROI. This kept program credible.

**3. Iterative Approach**
First wave took 6 months and saved $2M. That funded and justified subsequent waves.

### Three Things to Remember

**1. This isn't about reducing application count**

The goal isn't fewer applications. It's eliminating cost, complexity, and risk from the <20% of applications that consume >80% of your budget.

You have exactly the right number of applications today to run the business the way you run the business today. If you want fewer applications, you need to standardize business processes first.

**2. No rationalization without business process standardization**

IT-led rationalization programs fail. This must be business-led with IT as enabler. If your business units insist on running processes differently, they'll need different applications.

Executive sponsorship from CEO/CFO/COO level is critical for process standardization.

**3. This is proven methodology, not experimentation**

- Gartner TIME framework: Two decades, 143 engagements, 24,000+ applications
- Seven-step rationalization process: Validated across industries
- AI-readiness overlay: Builds on proven foundation

We're not making this up. We're applying what works and adapting it for AI enablement."

---

## Interactive Planning Exercise (Minutes 52-58)

"Let's spend the last few minutes planning YOUR next steps.

### **[EXERCISE 3: Planning Your Approach]**

I'm going to give you a worksheet. Work in small groups (3-4 people, mix of IT and business) to discuss:

**Worksheet Questions:**

**1. Path Selection**
- Which path (1, 2, or 3) best fits your current situation?
- What makes you lean that direction?
- What would need to be true to choose a different path?

**2. Sponsorship**
- Who would be the executive sponsor?
- Do they have authority for process standardization decisions?
- How do we secure their active participation?

**3. Known Redundancy**
- What's one area where you definitely have redundancy?
- What would consolidating that save (rough estimate)?
- What's blocking consolidation today?

**4. AI Pressure Points**
- Where is AI pressure highest?
- What capability would satisfy stakeholders?
- What's the cost if you roll out AI across current redundancy?

**5. Budget and Timing**
- What's your budget cycle and timeline?
- Is there budget for this already, or do you need business case?
- What approval process would this go through?

**6. Concerns and Questions**
- What concerns do you have about this approach?
- What questions remain unanswered?
- What would make you hesitant to move forward?

**[Small group discussions - 4 minutes]**

**[Report out - 2 minutes]**

Let's hear what you discussed. I'll capture this and it will inform how we scope the discovery conversation."

---

## Next Steps & Commitment (Minutes 58-60)

"Based on what I've heard today, here's what I recommend:

### Immediate Next Steps

**For everyone:**
1. **Identify executive sponsor candidate** - who has the right authority?
2. **Rough portfolio size** - approximately how many applications?
3. **Known redundancy areas** - where are the obvious opportunities?
4. **AI cost estimate** - what would AI rollout cost across current portfolio?

**Then schedule:**

**Discovery Conversation** (1-3 hours depending on path interest)
- Deep dive on your specific situation
- Review any existing assessment or inventory work
- Understand organizational dynamics and constraints
- Identify quick win opportunities
- Discuss team composition and governance

**From there:**

**Path 1 (Sprint):** Proposal in 1 week, start in 2-3 weeks
**Path 2 (Transformation):** Initial assessment in 1 week, proposal in 2 weeks, kickoff in 4-6 weeks
**Path 3 (Accelerated):** Integrated proposal in 2 weeks, Sprint starts in 2-3 weeks

### What We Need From You

To make the discovery conversation productive:

1. **Decision makers present** - the people who can authorize moving forward
2. **Portfolio data** (if available) - application list, costs, owners
3. **AI vendor communications** - what are vendors pitching/pricing?
4. **Known pain points** - where does portfolio cause problems today?
5. **Budget context** - what's realistic and what's the approval process?

### The Commitment We're Asking For

We're asking you to invest 1-3 hours in a discovery conversation to determine if this is right fit.

If we don't think we can help, we'll tell you. If the timing isn't right, we'll tell you.

But if there's a fit, we'll come back with a specific proposal that addresses your situation.

### One Final Thought

The organizations that are succeeding with AI aren't the ones with the best AI strategy.

They're the ones whose application portfolios can actually support AI adoption without multiplying costs and complexity.

That's what we help you build.
