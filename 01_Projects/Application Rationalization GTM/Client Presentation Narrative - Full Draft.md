# Application Rationalization Client Presentation - Full Narrative

**Target Duration:** 40 minutes
**Audience:** CIO + IT Leadership, potentially with CFO and Business Unit Leaders
**Context:** Initial pitch or advisory conversation

---

## OPENING (Minutes 0-3)

*[Assume you've done introductions, small talk, agenda setting]*

**"Let me start by acknowledging what's probably on your mind right now - AI.**

Every vendor you talk to is pitching AI features. Your board is asking about your AI strategy. Your business leaders are seeing competitors announce AI capabilities and they're wondering what you're doing about it.

And here's the challenging part: you KNOW you should be adopting AI. The business cases are compelling - productivity gains, cost reductions, competitive advantage. But you also know something else...

**Your application portfolio isn't ready for it.**

*[Pause - let that land]*

You've got redundant applications. You've got technical debt. You've got shadow IT nobody fully understands. And if you layer AI features on top of this complexity without addressing it first, you're going to multiply your problems - and your costs.

But here's the tension: **You can't wait two years to rationalize before adopting AI.** The market's moving too fast. Your business stakeholders won't accept that answer.

So the question becomes: **How do you respond to the AI pressure you're under RIGHT NOW, while also setting yourself up for sustainable success?**

That's what I want to talk about today."

---

## SECTION 1: Why This Matters Now (Minutes 3-8)

**"Let me show you what we're seeing in the market, because I think it'll feel familiar.**

Most enterprises have somewhere between 300-1,500 applications, depending on size. And here's what Gartner's research shows - based on analyzing over 24,000 applications across 143 enterprises:

- About 15-20% of those applications are redundant or overlapping
- Less than 20% of applications consume more than 80% of the IT budget
- And here's the kicker: **one in four applications in the 'eliminate' category is duplicative of another application you already have**

Now, let's talk about what happens when AI enters this picture.

### The AI Cost Multiplier Effect

Most AI features come with premium pricing. Microsoft Copilot is $30 per user per month on top of your Microsoft 365 subscription. Salesforce Einstein, ServiceNow AI agents, Adobe Firefly - they all come with incremental costs.

So here's the math: If you have redundant CRM systems, redundant collaboration tools, redundant service desk applications... you're about to pay AI premiums across ALL of them.

Let me give you a concrete example. One of our clients had:
- Five different CRM systems across business units
- Three collaboration platforms
- Four service desk tools

They came to us saying 'We want to adopt AI.' When we ran the numbers, rolling out AI features across their current portfolio would cost them an additional $4.2 million annually.

After rationalization - consolidating to one CRM, one collaboration platform, one service desk - that AI cost dropped to $1.8 million. **Same AI capabilities, $2.4 million less per year.** And that's just the incremental AI cost - that doesn't count the $3 million they were already wasting on redundant base subscriptions.

*[Pause for impact]*

**So here's why this matters NOW:** Every quarter you delay rationalization is another quarter you're either:
1. Not adopting AI at all (falling behind competitively)
2. Or adopting AI inefficiently across a bloated portfolio (locking in excessive costs)

The rationalization-before-AI window is closing. The decisions you make in the next 6-12 months will lock in your AI economics for the next 3-5 years."

---

## SECTION 2: The Traditional Approach - And the Gap (Minutes 8-13)

**"Now, if you've looked into application rationalization before, you've probably seen the traditional approach. And it's proven - this isn't new territory.

Gartner has a methodology called TIME - Tolerate, Invest, Migrate, Eliminate. You assess every application on two dimensions: technical fitness and business fitness. That tells you what to do with each one.

*[Brief explanation of quadrants - you'd have visual here]*

- **Tolerate:** It works fine technically, but business doesn't love it. Leave it alone for now.
- **Invest:** High value, keep improving it
- **Migrate:** Business needs it, but it's built on outdated technology. Modernize it.
- **Eliminate:** Low value, poor technology. Decommission or replace.

This methodology works. We've seen organizations achieve 15-30% cost reduction and significantly improve agility.

### But here's the challenge:

Traditional rationalization is a multi-year program. You're talking about:
- 3-6 months just to assess the portfolio
- Business process standardization discussions (because rationalization without process standardization fails)
- 18-24 months to execute the consolidations and migrations
- Ongoing governance to prevent the portfolio from bloating again

And here's what we've learned from the research: **IT-led rationalization programs fail.** This has to be business-led, because you're fundamentally changing business processes, not just swapping out applications.

*[Let that sink in]*

So if you're a CIO today, you're stuck:
- Your business stakeholders want AI NOW
- But doing AI right requires rationalization
- And rationalization takes 2+ years and requires business leadership
- Which means you're going to tell business leaders 'No AI yet, and by the way, you need to lead the program that will eventually let us do AI'

**That's a losing position.**

So we had to ask: Is there a different way?"

---

## SECTION 3: Our Approach - Three Paths (Minutes 13-25)

**"What we've developed is an approach that recognizes different organizations are in different situations. There's no one-size-fits-all.

Some of you need to respond to AI pressure immediately - you've got business stakeholders who won't wait.

Others have a clear mandate for comprehensive transformation and the executive support to make it happen.

And some of you need both - quick wins to build momentum while setting up for deeper transformation.

So we've structured this as **three distinct paths**, and you choose the one that fits your situation.

---

### PATH 1: AI Acceleration Sprint - For Immediate Response

This is for when you need to move fast. Maybe your CFO just asked why we're not using AI yet. Maybe your competitor just launched an AI feature. Maybe your sales team is demanding Copilot and they don't want to hear about portfolio complexity.

**Here's what this is:**
A 60-90 day engagement where we:

1. **Rapidly assess your portfolio** - Not a comprehensive TIME analysis, but a focused look at: which applications are AI-ready right now? What's blocking AI adoption? Where can we get quick wins?

2. **Enable 1-2 high-value AI capabilities** - We identify the highest-ROI AI opportunities that you can execute quickly. Maybe it's enabling Copilot for your sales team. Maybe it's turning on AI features in your service desk. Whatever it is, we get it live and demonstrating value.

3. **Create your AI roadmap** - Now that we've done one sprint, we have clear visibility into what else is possible, what's blocked by portfolio complexity, and what it would take to scale AI adoption.

4. **Build the business case** - We quantify the ROI from the sprint, and more importantly, we show the cost of NOT rationalizing if you want to scale AI across the enterprise.

**Who is this for?**
- You need to respond to business pressure now
- You may not have budget or mandate for comprehensive transformation yet
- You want proof points before committing to a larger program

**What you get:**
- Immediate AI value in 90 days
- Clear understanding of your portfolio constraints
- Business case for broader rationalization if you choose to continue

This can be a standalone engagement. You get complete value even if you stop here. Or, it naturally leads to the next path when you're ready.

---

### PATH 2: AI-Ready Portfolio Transformation - For Comprehensive Change

This is for when you have a clear mandate for rationalization. Maybe the CFO has given you a budget reduction target. Maybe you're going through an M&A and need to consolidate portfolios. Maybe you just know the portfolio is a mess and you're ready to fix it properly.

**Here's what this is:**
An 18-24 month comprehensive program following the proven Gartner methodology:

1. **Full TIME assessment** - Every application scored on business and technical fitness, mapped to business capabilities, cost-analyzed. Plus we overlay AI-readiness assessment.

2. **Business process standardization roadmap** - Because rationalization without process standardization fails. We work with your business leaders to identify where standardization creates value and where local variation is legitimate.

3. **Seven-step rationalization execution** - From inventory to assessment to consolidation to decommissioning. We don't just give you a plan - we help you execute it.

4. **Application undertaker capability** - We help you build the internal capability to systematically decommission applications, including data archiving, dependency removal, and governance.

5. **Continuous modernization framework** - So the portfolio doesn't bloat again. This isn't one-and-done, it's building an ongoing discipline.

**Who is this for?**
- You have executive sponsorship for transformation
- You have budget allocated
- You're ready for comprehensive, sustainable change

**What you get:**
- 15-30% portfolio cost reduction (typical)
- Modern, AI-capable architecture
- Agility to respond to future business needs
- Foundation for scaling AI adoption

You can enter this path directly - we don't require the Sprint first. Our assessment phase covers the ground the Sprint would have, just more comprehensively.

---

### PATH 3: Accelerated Transformation Program - For Both Quick Wins and Deep Change

This is when you need to do both. You need quick wins to satisfy business stakeholders and build momentum. AND you're committed to comprehensive transformation.

**Here's what this is:**
We combine both programs into one seamless engagement:

- **Months 1-3:** AI Acceleration Sprint (immediate value)
- **Months 4-27:** Full Portfolio Transformation (comprehensive change)

**The integration benefit:**
The Sprint isn't just a quick win - it directly informs the transformation. We learn from what works and what's blocked. We use those insights to accelerate the rationalization roadmap. You're not just doing two separate programs - you're doing one integrated program where early phases inform later phases.

**Who is this for?**
- You need to respond to business pressure immediately
- You ALSO have commitment for deeper transformation
- You want the most comprehensive approach

**What you get:**
- Everything from both paths
- Faster transformation (Sprint insights accelerate planning)
- Continuous momentum (no gap between quick wins and deep work)

We offer this as a bundled program with integrated pricing because it's the most effective way to both satisfy immediate needs and achieve sustainable transformation."

---

**[Pause here - this is a natural place to check in with the client]**

**"Before I go further - which of these resonates with your situation? Are you in 'need to move fast' mode? 'Ready for comprehensive transformation'? Or both?"**

*[This is where you'd have a conversation, understand their context, then continue accordingly]*

---

## SECTION 4: How We Work (Minutes 25-32)

**"Good. Now let me show you how we actually do this work, because methodology matters. This isn't about coming in with a predetermined answer - it's about systematic assessment and business-led decision-making.

### Our Foundation: Gartner TIME + Field Experience

Everything we do is built on Gartner's TIME methodology. This has been refined over almost two decades, tested across 143 enterprises, with over 24,000 applications assessed. We're not inventing new theory here - we're applying proven best practices.

But here's what we've added: **the AI-readiness lens.** Traditional TIME tells you which applications to tolerate, invest in, migrate, or eliminate based on technical and business fitness. We overlay that with: which applications enable AI adoption? Which ones block it? How do AI considerations change your rationalization priorities?

### The Team Structure

This is not a consultant-driven program. It's a partnership. Here's how teams typically work:

**Your Side:**
- **Executive Sponsor** - Usually the CIO, sometimes CFO. This person has authority to make portfolio decisions and drive business process discussions.
- **Program Manager** - Day-to-day leader from your team. Coordinates workstreams, manages timeline.
- **Business Application Owners** - These are your SMEs who understand how applications support business processes. They score business fitness.
- **Enterprise Architect** - Scores technical fitness, identifies dependencies, owns the technical roadmap.
- **Business Leaders** - This is critical. We need your VP of Sales, VP of Operations, VP of Finance engaged in process standardization discussions. Without them, rationalization fails.

**Our Side:**
- **Engagement Leader** - Me or a senior consultant. Strategic guidance, stakeholder management, ultimate accountability.
- **Portfolio Assessment Lead** - Runs the TIME analysis, facilitates scoring sessions, builds the assessments.
- **Rationalization Execution Lead** - Once decisions are made, manages the consolidation/migration projects.
- **Application Undertaker Specialist** - This is a unique role. This person systematically decommissions applications - removes dependencies, archives data, ensures nothing breaks. Most organizations don't have this capability, so we help build it.

### The Governance Model

Decision rights are clear:

- **Steering Committee** (meets monthly): Executive sponsor, business leaders, enterprise architect. They make the strategic decisions: which applications to consolidate, what the roadmap looks like, where to invest.

- **Working Team** (meets weekly): Program managers, architects, our consultants. They execute the work, bring recommendations to steering committee, manage day-to-day issues.

- **Business Process Workshops** (as needed): When we identify overlapping applications, we facilitate sessions with business stakeholders to map processes and determine if standardization makes sense. Remember: no rationalization without process standardization.

### The Phased Delivery Approach

Let me walk through what actually happens, using the full transformation program as an example:

**Phase 1: Assessment & Roadmap (Months 1-4)**

*Month 1-2: Inventory & Data Collection*
- We build the application inventory. This seems basic, but most organizations don't have a complete, accurate inventory. We capture: application name, vendor, users, costs, business capabilities supported, technical stack.
- We identify overlaps. Where are multiple applications doing the same thing?

*Month 3-4: Fitness Scoring*
- Business fitness: Working with business owners, we score each application on usability, training, feature completeness, strategic alignment.
- Technical fitness: Working with architects, we score maintainability, security, supportability, architectural alignment.
- AI-readiness: New dimension we've added - platform modernity, vendor AI roadmap, integration capabilities.

*Output: TIME Chart + AI Readiness Heatmap*
- Visual representation of your entire portfolio
- Clear identification of rationalization opportunities
- Prioritized roadmap for next 18-24 months

**Phase 2: Quick Wins & Momentum Building (Months 5-10)**

We don't wait until everything is planned to start executing. We identify 2-3 high-value, lower-complexity rationalization opportunities and execute them early.

Why? Two reasons:
1. **Demonstrates value.** Business stakeholders see cost savings and process improvements quickly. Builds credibility for the longer program.
2. **Builds capability.** Your team learns the consolidation and decommissioning process on smaller projects before tackling the complex ones.

Typical quick wins:
- Consolidating duplicate productivity tools (multiple project management systems → one)
- Retiring unused or zombie applications (surprisingly common)
- Standardizing on one vendor where you have multiple overlapping products

**Phase 3: Strategic Rationalization (Months 11-24)**

Now we tackle the big ones. The expensive, complex, mission-critical applications where consolidation delivers the most value but also requires the most work.

This is where business process standardization becomes critical. When you're consolidating five CRM systems into one, you're not just migrating data - you're standardizing how Sales operates across business units.

For each major consolidation:
- Business case: Cost savings, process improvements, AI enablement
- Process mapping: How does each application support workflows today?
- Gap analysis: What functionality exists in retiring apps that isn't in the standard?
- Migration plan: Data migration, user training, cutover approach
- Decommissioning: The application undertaker ensures clean removal

**Throughout: Governance & Course Correction**

Monthly steering committee reviews:
- Progress against plan
- Cost savings realized
- Issues and decisions needed
- Adjustments to roadmap based on what we're learning

This is an adaptive program. As we execute early phases, we learn things that inform later phases. The roadmap evolves based on business priorities and what we discover.

### The Application Undertaker Capability

Let me spend a minute on this because it's often overlooked, and it's critical.

Most organizations are good at implementing new applications. But they're terrible at decommissioning old ones. So portfolios just grow and grow.

The application undertaker role is about systematic decommissioning:
- **Dependency mapping:** What other systems rely on this application? What integrations need to be removed?
- **Data archiving:** Legal often requires data retention even after application is retired. What's the retention policy? How do we archive and make data accessible if needed?
- **Infrastructure cleanup:** Servers, databases, licenses - everything gets properly terminated. No orphaned infrastructure still costing money.

We help you build this capability internally so it becomes an ongoing discipline, not just a one-time project activity.

*[Pause]*

**Now, for the AI Acceleration Sprint path, this is obviously compressed.** We're not doing comprehensive TIME analysis of every application. We're doing rapid assessment focused on: where can we enable AI quickly? What's blocking AI adoption?

But the principles are the same - systematic assessment, business-led decisions, clear governance. Just faster and more focused.

Does this methodology feel solid to you? Any questions about how we'd actually work together?"

---

## SECTION 5: What Success Looks Like (Minutes 32-37)

**"Let me be specific about outcomes, because 'rationalization' can feel abstract. What will you actually achieve?

### Quantified Outcomes

Based on Gartner data across 143 engagements and our own client work, here's what organizations typically achieve:

**Cost Reduction: 15-30%**
- Portfolio operating costs reduced by 15-30%
- This includes license costs, infrastructure, support, maintenance
- The range depends on starting point - more redundancy = more savings potential

For a $50 million annual application budget, that's $7.5M to $15M in annual savings. And remember - these are recurring savings, year after year.

**AI Cost Avoidance: 20-40%**
- This is the new metric we're tracking
- By rationalizing BEFORE scaling AI adoption, you avoid redundant AI licensing costs
- For most organizations, this adds millions in annual avoidance once AI adoption scales

**Complexity Reduction: 30-50%**
- Typical reduction in number of applications (though remember - this isn't the primary goal)
- More importantly: reduction in integration complexity, technical debt, security surface area

**Agility Improvement: 40%+**
- Time to implement new capabilities or make changes decreases significantly
- This is harder to quantify but often becomes the most valuable outcome
- Business can move faster because technology isn't the constraint anymore

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Decommissioning legacy applications reduces security vulnerabilities
- Fewer applications = smaller attack surface
- Modern platforms have better security controls
- Compliance becomes easier to manage

### Timeline to Value

Here's when you start seeing results:

**Months 1-6:**
- Assessment complete - you have clarity on portfolio health and opportunities
- Quick wins delivering - early cost savings and process improvements
- Business case validated - ROI projections confirmed with real data

**Months 7-12:**
- First wave of strategic consolidations complete
- Measurable cost reduction (licenses not renewed, infrastructure decommissioned)
- AI pilots enabled in rationalized areas
- Momentum building - business stakeholders seeing value

**Months 13-24:**
- Major consolidations complete
- Target cost savings achieved or exceeded
- Modern, AI-capable architecture in place
- Continuous modernization framework operational

For the AI Acceleration Sprint, timeline compresses dramatically:
- **Days 1-30:** Assessment and planning
- **Days 31-60:** AI capability implementation
- **Days 61-90:** Validation, measurement, roadmap delivery

You're seeing AI value in production by day 90, with clear path to scale.

### Case Example

Let me give you a concrete example. A mid-sized financial services firm came to us with a familiar problem:
- 600+ applications in portfolio
- Business demanding AI capabilities for customer service and compliance
- CFO pushing for cost reduction
- CIO stuck in the middle

We did the full transformation program. Here's what happened:

**Assessment findings:**
- 18% of applications were redundant
- 4 different CRM systems across business units
- 3 customer service platforms
- 220 applications hadn't been used in over 6 months (zombie apps)

**Execution over 20 months:**
- Consolidated to 1 CRM (Salesforce)
- Consolidated to 1 customer service platform (ServiceNow)
- Decommissioned 180 applications (zombies plus duplicates)
- Migrated key apps to cloud-native platforms

**Outcomes:**
- **$12M annual cost reduction** (24% of $50M portfolio)
- **$3.8M AI cost avoidance** (annual, based on current AI adoption plans)
- **Portfolio reduced from 600 to 420 applications** (30% reduction)
- **AI capabilities deployed** across customer service, compliance monitoring, sales intelligence
- **ROI: 3.2x** over three years (investment: $4.8M, benefits: $15.4M)

More importantly - the CFO got cost reduction, the business got AI capabilities, and the CIO transformed from blocker to enabler.

### How We Measure Progress

Throughout the engagement, we track:

**Leading Indicators** (tell us if we're on track):
- Applications assessed (% of portfolio)
- Consolidation projects approved
- Decommissioning projects completed
- Business process standardization workshops completed

**Lagging Indicators** (tell us we've delivered value):
- Portfolio cost reduction (monthly)
- Application count reduction
- AI capabilities enabled
- Business satisfaction scores
- Time-to-market for new capabilities

Monthly dashboard shows steering committee exactly where we are vs. plan, what's at risk, what decisions are needed.

### The Commitment

Here's what we guarantee: At the end of assessment phase (Month 4 for full program, Day 90 for Sprint), if you're not seeing clear path to ROI that justifies continuing, you can stop. We don't take you 24 months into a program before you know if it's working. Value and progress are visible early and continuously.

Does this give you confidence in what you'd actually achieve?"

---

## SECTION 6: Why Now & Next Steps (Minutes 37-40)

**"Let me bring this together with why timing matters and what happens next.

### Why This Can't Wait

I mentioned earlier that the rationalization-before-AI window is closing. Let me be more specific about what that means.

**What's Happening Right Now:**
- Every SaaS vendor is adding AI features and adjusting pricing
- Your business stakeholders are seeing AI demos and making demands
- Some of your teams are probably already experimenting with AI tools (hello, shadow IT)
- Your competitors are announcing AI capabilities

**What Happens If You Wait:**

**Scenario 1: You delay rationalization and adopt AI on current portfolio**
- You lock in high costs (AI premiums across redundant apps)
- You create AI sprawl (different AI tools in every business unit)
- You miss the cost savings (rationalization is harder after AI is embedded)
- You compound technical debt (AI features built on messy foundation)

**Scenario 2: You delay AI adoption to rationalize first**
- You fall behind competitively (competitors move faster)
- You lose business support (stakeholders see you as blocker)
- You miss revenue opportunities (AI-driven capabilities your competitors have)
- You struggle to retain talent (people want to work with modern technology)

**Scenario 3: You do both poorly**
- Pilots everywhere, no strategy
- Rationalization happens slowly while AI sprawls
- You end up with worst of both worlds

### The Window: Next 6-12 Months

Here's what we've observed: Organizations that start rationalization with AI-readiness as an explicit goal in 2025 will be positioned to scale AI adoption in 2026-2027 at reasonable costs.

Organizations that wait will either:
- Adopt AI expensively (across bloated portfolios)
- Or lag competitively (while they finally rationalize)

The best time to start this was a year ago. The second best time is now.

### Next Steps - Clear Path Forward

Based on our conversation today, here's what I'd propose:

*[Adjust based on which path client indicated interest in]*

**If Path 1 (AI Acceleration Sprint) fits your situation:**

**Step 1 (This Week):**
- Quick discovery call with your key stakeholders
- Confirm scope: Which business capability or AI use case to target for quick win
- Review application landscape in that domain

**Step 2 (Week 2):**
- Proposal with specific scope, timeline, and investment
- Statement of Work for your review

**Step 3 (Week 3-4):**
- Contract finalized
- Kick-off and team mobilization

**Step 4 (Day 1 of engagement):**
- We're assessing, planning, and moving toward AI enablement
- 90 days later, you have AI capability in production and roadmap for scaling

---

**If Path 2 (Full Transformation) fits your situation:**

**Step 1 (Weeks 1-2):**
- Discovery phase - we meet with your key stakeholders
  - CIO/CTO and IT leadership
  - CFO or finance leader (cost/benefit authority)
  - Business unit leaders (process standardization authority)
- Review: current portfolio state, AI strategy, business priorities, constraints

**Step 2 (Weeks 3-4):**
- Detailed proposal including:
  - Specific scope and approach
  - Timeline and milestones
  - Investment and expected ROI
  - Team structure and governance model
  - Success criteria and measurement

**Step 3 (Weeks 5-6):**
- Contract negotiation and finalization
- Steering committee formation
- Team mobilization

**Step 4 (Month 1):**
- Formal kick-off
- Assessment phase begins
- Early quick-win identification

---

**If Path 3 (Accelerated Program) fits your situation:**

Same process as Path 2, but we structure it as one integrated program from the start:
- Months 1-3 deliver Sprint outcomes
- Months 4-27 deliver transformation outcomes
- Seamless transition, integrated planning

### Investment Range

To give you rough sense of investment:

- **AI Acceleration Sprint:** $75K - $150K (depending on scope and complexity)
- **Full Transformation:** $500K - $1.5M (depending on portfolio size and complexity)
- **Accelerated Program:** $550K - $1.6M (bundled pricing, slight discount vs. separate)

These are ranges - specific pricing comes after discovery when we understand your situation.

### The Decision You're Making

You're not just deciding whether to hire consultants. You're deciding:
- How you'll respond to AI pressure your business is under
- Whether you'll address portfolio complexity now or let it compound
- If you'll spend the next 3 years managing AI sprawl or building on solid foundation

### What I Need From You Today

*[Be direct about next steps]*

If this resonates, here's what happens next:
1. You decide which path fits your situation
2. We schedule discovery calls with your key stakeholders
3. We come back with a specific proposal tailored to your environment

If this doesn't resonate, or timing isn't right, that's fine too. I'd rather you tell me now than waste your time or ours.

**So - what questions do you have? And what feels like the right next step?"**

## Notes on Delivery

### Key Pause Points for Engagement:
1. After opening (3 min) - gauge if AI/portfolio tension resonates
2. After Section 1 (8 min) - confirm they see the cost multiplier effect
3. After Section 3 (25 min) - **Critical checkpoint:** Which path fits their situation?
4. After Section 4 (32 min) - Questions about methodology
5. End of Section 6 (40 min) - Clear next step decision

### Tone Calibration:
- **Urgency without fear-mongering:** AI is opportunity + risk, not just threat
- **Authority without arrogance:** Proven methodology, but we're partners not experts dropping in
- **Clarity without oversimplification:** This is complex work, but we make it manageable

### Visual Support Needed:
- TIME quadrant diagram (Section 2)
- AI cost multiplier calculation (Section 1)
- Three paths comparison table (Section 3)
- Team structure diagram (Section 4)
- Timeline and milestones (Section 4 & 5)
- Case study outcomes (Section 5)

### Adaptation Notes:
- **30-minute version:** Cut Section 4 detail, shorten case study
- **60-minute version:** Add more Q&A, deeper dive on methodology, workshop elements
- **Executive audience:** Lead with business outcomes, minimize methodology detail
- **IT audience:** Can go deeper on TIME model, technical fitness criteria, tools
