## Slide 1: Title Slide

**Main Title:** Transforming Seven Corners Customer Experience with AI

**Subtitle:** A Phased Approach to 24/7 Intelligent Service

**Elements:**
- Your company name/logo
- Date
- Presenters' names

**Visual:** Clean, professional title slide with Seven Corners branding consideration

---

## Slide 2: The Moment of Truth

**Headline:** "Your Customers Need You When It Matters Most"

**Visual:** Split-screen illustration or photos showing two scenarios:
- LEFT: Traveler at airport/hotel at night, phone in hand, looking stressed (2 AM emergency)
- RIGHT: Family at laptop, looking at insurance options, confused by documentation

**Key Points (on slide or talking points):**
- Travel insurance isn't a commodity - it's protection during vulnerable moments
- Your customers span 12+ time zones, speak 50+ languages
- Questions range from simple ("What's covered?") to complex ("I'm hospitalized in Thailand - what now?")

**Talking Points:**
- These are the moments that define Seven Corners' reputation
- Current model: Great agents, but limited by time zones and capacity
- The question: How do we scale that human expertise?

**Emotional Hook:** Set up the human stakes before diving into business metrics

## Slide 3: The Contact Center Reality

**Headline:** "Three Forces Reshaping Customer Service"

**Visual:** Three columns/icons showing pressure points

**Column 1: Customer Expectations**
- Icon: Clock/24-7 symbol
- Text: "Instant answers, any channel, any time"
- Stat: "73% of customers expect immediate service regardless of time" (industry benchmark)

**Column 2: Operational Costs**
- Icon: Dollar sign/upward trend graph
- Text: "Agent costs rising, volumes increasing"
- Stat: "Average cost per contact: $12 and climbing"

**Column 3: Competitive Pressure**
- Icon: Competitors/market share
- Text: "Digital-first insurers setting new standards"
- Stat: "42% of travel insurance shoppers choose based on customer service quality"

**Talking Points:**
- These forces aren't new, but AI has fundamentally changed what's possible
- The companies that move now gain 18-24 month advantage
- Question isn't WHETHER to adopt AI, but HOW to do it right

**Transition:** "So what does 'doing it right' actually look like?"

## Slide 4: What If This Were Possible?

**Headline:** "Reimagining the Customer Journey"

**Visual:** Side-by-side customer journey comparison (process flow diagram)

**BEFORE (Current State):**
```
Customer searches website FAQ
  ↓ (Can't find answer - 5 min)
Waits on hold
  ↓ (15 minutes average)
Explains situation to agent
  ↓ (5 min)
Gets transferred, explains AGAIN
  ↓ (Agent lookup - 10 min)
Finally gets answer

TOTAL TIME: 45+ minutes
CUSTOMER FEELING: Frustrated
```

**AFTER (AI-Powered):**
```
Opens chat on website
  ↓ (Instant)
Authenticated automatically
  ↓ (2 seconds)
AI understands question + policy context
  ↓ (5 seconds)
Answers with personalized info
  ↓ (20 seconds)
[If needed] Escalates to agent WITH full context

TOTAL TIME: 30 seconds - 3 minutes
CUSTOMER FEELING: Impressed
```

**Key Points:**
- Not about replacing agents - augmenting them
- AI handles routine 24/7, escalates complex cases with context
- Agents focus on high-value, empathetic interactions

**Talking Points:**
- This isn't theoretical - this is what Microsoft's AI stack enables TODAY
- The difference: Agents stop being glorified FAQ lookup
- Instead: They handle the genuinely complex, empathetic work only humans can do

## Slide 6: AI That Understands Insurance Conversations

**Headline:** "Real Customer Experience"

**Visual:** Chat interface mockup showing actual conversation

**Conversation Example:**
```
CUSTOMER:
"I'm supposed to fly to Paris tomorrow but I tested
positive for COVID. Am I covered?"

AI RESPONSE:
"I'm sorry to hear you're not feeling well. Let me help
you with that.

I've pulled up your Trip Protection Plus policy. Yes,
you're covered for trip cancellation due to illness,
including COVID-19.

Here's what happens next:
1. You'll need a doctor's note confirming you can't travel
2. File a claim within 30 days
3. Keep all receipts for non-refundable expenses

Would you like me to:
→ Start your claim now
→ Email you the detailed steps
→ Connect you with a claims specialist"
```

**Why This Works: (callout boxes or annotations)**
- ✓ Shows empathy ("I'm sorry to hear...")
- ✓ Understands insurance terminology (Trip Protection Plus)
- ✓ Personalizes to their specific policy
- ✓ Provides clear, actionable next steps
- ✓ Offers choices (customer maintains control)
- ✓ Seamless path to human if needed

**Talking Points:**
- This isn't a generic chatbot - it's insurance-aware
- Notice how it combines empathy + accuracy + action
- The AI knows to offer human handoff for emotionally charged situations
- This level of sophistication is possible TODAY with proper implementation

## Customization Checklist Before Presenting

**Validate These Details:**
- [ ] Seven Corners' actual contact center volumes (replace 150K assumption)
- [ ] Current CSAT and NPS scores (to calculate realistic improvement targets)
- [ ] Existing Microsoft investments (Office 365, Azure, Dynamics?)
- [ ] Known pain points from any pre-conversations
- [ ] Decision-makers' titles and names
- [ ] Competitive landscape (any known AI initiatives by competitors?)
- [ ] Budget authority and approval process
- [ ] Timeline constraints (fiscal year, budget cycles, strategic planning)

**Tailor Messaging To:**
- [ ] Primary decision-maker's priorities (CEO = ROI, CX leader = customer impact, IT = integration)
- [ ] Company culture (conservative vs. innovative, data-driven vs. intuition)
- [ ] Known objections or concerns
- [ ] Relationship stage (cold call vs. warm introduction vs. RFP response)

---

## Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: "How do we know this will work for our specific business?"**
A: "That's exactly why we start with discovery. The $15K discovery engagement gives you a custom blueprint based on YOUR data, not industry averages. You'll see the actual ROI case for Seven Corners before committing to implementation."

**Q: "What happens to our contact center agents?"**
A: "Agent roles evolve, they don't disappear. They stop being FAQ lookup and become true customer advocates handling complex, high-value interactions. We've seen agent satisfaction improve because the work becomes more meaningful."

**Q: "Why Microsoft vs. other AI platforms?"**
A: "Three reasons: (1) Enterprise security and compliance you need for insurance, (2) Integration with systems you likely already use, (3) Our expertise - we've implemented this exact stack successfully."

**Q: "How long until we see ROI?"**
A: "Conservative estimate is 9 months. But you'll see operational impact in Month 4 when MVP launches. Some clients hit break-even in 6 months with aggressive adoption."

**Q: "What if it doesn't work?"**
A: "That's the beauty of the phased approach. After Phase 1 ($150K), you have a working MVP and real data. If metrics don't hit targets, you can pause. You're not locked into the full $450K."

**Q: "Can you guarantee the 356% ROI?"**
A: "No - because ROI depends on your specific volumes, costs, and adoption. What we can guarantee: transparent metrics, monthly reviews, and course corrections if needed. The 356% is based on conservative industry benchmarks we'll validate with your data during discovery."

**Q: "How disruptive is this to our current operations?"**
A: "Phase 1 is additive, not disruptive. We layer the AI on your website chat - existing phone/email channels continue unchanged. Agents get gradual training, not a sudden switch. By Phase 3, your team has 18 months of experience with the technology."

**Q: "What about data privacy and security?"**
A: "Microsoft Azure has enterprise-grade compliance: HIPAA, GDPR, SOC2, PCI DSS. Customer data stays in your tenant, encrypted in transit and at rest. We'll map exact requirements during discovery."
