## Highlights
- Fuck being bored. You shouldn’t ever be bored. You can always read and be smarter. You can always work out and be in better shape. You can always play your instrument and get better at it. Your space can always be cleaner. Blue-collar work is when you work with your hands—white-collar work is behind a desk. I’m not as grimy as my father, who made his living with a wrench, but everything I have comes from working with my hands. [Location 3050](https://readwise.io/open/181044709) ^rw181044709
