## Highlights
- We dug deep into the search results for different queries and found one interesting phenomenon: very often, we ranked accessory items on the top. For example, many iPhone cases would rank at the top of the results when buyers searched the term “iPhone.” Although those accessories were popular on the site, they weren’t what the user had been searching for, so it created what we call “accessory pollution” and led to a bad user experience.

- The lesson was obvious: be careful to pick the right measurement because it will inform the direction of your AI. [Location 141](https://readwise.io/open/181044720) ^rw181044720
- “Go solve the hard problems,” she said. “Everything else will sort itself out.” [Location 165](https://readwise.io/open/181044721) ^rw181044721
- Within a few years, it will be just as hard to find a company without an AI strategy. Companies that aren’t working toward developing an AI strategy today are likely to fare as well as companies that [Location 208](https://readwise.io/open/181044722) ^rw181044722
- “Artificial intelligence is the science and engineering of making computers behave in ways that, until recently, we thought required human intelligence.” —Andrew Moore, Former Dean of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University [Location 230](https://readwise.io/open/181044723) ^rw181044723
- this example also illustrates a fundamental truth of responsible AI: it’s difficult. [Location 257](https://readwise.io/open/181044724) ^rw181044724
- What we call AI, however, only became a formalized field of study at a Dartmouth College conference in 1956. There, the term “artificial intelligence” was coined.8 The field has [Location 289](https://readwise.io/open/181044725) ^rw181044725
- AI refers broadly to machines that perform functions that, when performed by humans, require intelligence. [Location 295](https://readwise.io/open/181044726) ^rw181044726
- AI is often poorly understood as a black box. Something goes in one end, and magic comes out the other. This “black box” thinking is only partially accurate—the box isn’t actually opaque. [Location 304](https://readwise.io/open/181044727) ^rw181044727
- Imagine you have a new puppy. You want the dog to sit down every time you say, “Sit.” You repeat the command and give your dog a treat whenever it connects the dots and gets it right. After a while, the dog will infer that it is time to sit whenever it hears the word “sit.” [Location 312](https://readwise.io/open/181044728) ^rw181044728
- want it to make a prediction when you feed it new data. The process of using a trained machine learning algorithm to make a prediction is called “inference.” [Location 323](https://readwise.io/open/181044729) ^rw181044729
- The new, emerging practices to streamline managing the machine learning life cycle are called MLOps. [Location 327](https://readwise.io/open/181044730) ^rw181044730
- Let’s take a look at another popular machine learning model: the decision tree. [Location 331](https://readwise.io/open/181044731) ^rw181044731
- supervised learning. The overwhelming majority of AI-use cases in the business world use supervised learning models. This is a fancy way of describing algorithms that are trying to mimic human decision-making in specific scenarios using data that previous humans have created as the training data. This is because there are many tasks in business [Location 345](https://readwise.io/open/181044732) ^rw181044732
- Unsupervised learning, in contrast, is trained on data that have no right answers. It uses algorithms to find the inherent, latent structures in the data. [Location 350](https://readwise.io/open/181044733) ^rw181044733
- And a third common model is reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning, rather than being trained on data, requires the model to be set up to learn by doing through trial and error. [Location 351](https://readwise.io/open/181044734) ^rw181044734
- In the development of a tool like COTA, business-focused roles like that of Product Manager are key. The data science team is focused on making the model faster and more accurate across the board—but the person focused on business objectives is going to be the crucial voice when it comes to defining how to balance speed, risk, and accuracy. [Location 389](https://readwise.io/open/181044735) ^rw181044735
- An AI model needs a specific problem to solve in the present, not a faraway future goal. This is partly because AI isn’t a “set it and forget it” type of system that will keep churning out results without human intervention. It requires constant maintenance, management, and course-correction to continue to provide meaningful, desired output. [Location 446](https://readwise.io/open/181044736) ^rw181044736
- eBay has, so far, been highly successful in their transition to an AI-led company because they developed a cohesive, holistic strategy. [Location 600](https://readwise.io/open/181044737) ^rw181044737
- It’s more important to pick the single right problem to start with and build momentum with its solution. That’s called identifying the “Goldilocks problem.” [Location 742](https://readwise.io/open/181044738) ^rw181044738
- This focus—identifying a narrow problem that had business importance—was critical to its success. [Location 751](https://readwise.io/open/181044739) ^rw181044739 
- See also: [[favorite]] 
- As we’ve discussed, the best Goldilocks problem is small enough that you can solve it quickly. Problems that involve classifying something into one of two buckets—password-reset [Location 783](https://readwise.io/open/181044740) ^rw181044740
- Start simple. Start with something that a human can do reliably over and over again but that a computer could do at a scale and speed a human could not. [Location 795](https://readwise.io/open/181044741) ^rw181044741 
- See also: [[favorite]] 
- Another characteristic of a good Goldilocks problem is a large bank of historical data obtained through past instances of solving that same problem. [Location 806](https://readwise.io/open/181044742) ^rw181044742
- It’s also important to consider the provenance of your data. It’s incredibly common in an enterprise to find data scattered throughout databases in different departments without any documentation about where it’s from or how it got [Location 1008](https://readwise.io/open/181044743) ^rw181044743
- As you evaluate whether your data covers your use cases, make sure you take into account the quality of that data. As [Location 1035](https://readwise.io/open/181044744) ^rw181044744
- Data quality also depends on the accuracy of its annotations. To some extent, you’ll want to have quality control processes [Location 1039](https://readwise.io/open/181044745) ^rw181044745
