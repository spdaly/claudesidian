## Highlights
- My experiences have led me to a crucial realization: successful AI is really all about us, the humans. AI has been built by people, and it is used by people. Without human insight and interaction, AI loses its essence and purpose. The most successful and profitable AI initiatives I have seen are those that are in strong connections with people.

- Nature gave ants the capacity to carry up to 50 times their weight and cheetahs the ability to run super‐fast. We humans are not as strong or as fast. But we were given another power: the one to create technology. And thanks to technology, we too can carry heavy loads, move at the speed of sound, and do much more! It's like we're the “tech‐animals” of the world. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/814746465) ^rw814746465
- Let me give you some mind‐blowing examples of how technology has improved our world. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/814746921) ^rw814746921
- I call this the “AI obesity.” Just like how we got hooked on fast food, now we're binging on fast creativity, fast connections, fast decisions, and even fast love. It's like we're addicted to the fast food of AI, consuming it in large quantities without thinking about the consequences.
  We're settling for “good enough” instead of striving for excellence, and we're losing our jobs, our businesses, our attention, our kids’ safety, and our humanity in the process. If you ask me, AI obesity is a far more critical danger for our humanity than any hypothetical Terminator‐style robot apocalypse!
