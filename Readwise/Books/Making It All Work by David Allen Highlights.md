## Highlights
- The art of progress is to preserve order amid change and to preserve change amid order. —Alfred North Whitehead   Much of what sophisticates loftily refer to as the “complexity” of the real world is in fact the inconsistency in their own minds. —Thomas Sowell [Location 69](https://readwise.io/open/158156688) ^rw158156688
- As Olympic athletes have known for years, it greatly improves perception and performance to visualize a successful outcome to any endeavor, before you actually undertake it. [Location 236](https://readwise.io/open/158156689) ^rw158156689
- I can guarantee you that, with a willingness to experiment, a small amount of focus and discipline, and mastery of a few simple techniques, those kinds of results and even greater ones are achievable. [Location 245](https://readwise.io/open/158156690) ^rw158156690
- Just as the tumultuous chaos of a thunderstorm brings a nurturing rain that allows life to flourish, so too in human affairs times of advancement are preceded by times of disorder. Success comes to those who can weather the storm. —I Ching [Location 268](https://readwise.io/open/158156691) ^rw158156691
- By writing it down, I was able at least to begin to loosen its grip on me. Were these principles that could be applied anywhere, with anyone, at any time, and produce the same result? [Location 289](https://readwise.io/open/158156692) ^rw158156692
- Programmers work long hours trying to design stuff that keeps them from having to work long hours. The nature of computing is to make things easier, faster, more powerful, and more coherent—in other words, to help get more done with less effort. Maximize output with minimum input is the essence of both productivity improvement and GTD principles, so it would seem natural that people attracted to the world of computers would gravitate to ideas that line up with those interests. [Location 306](https://readwise.io/open/158156693) ^rw158156693
- I’ve often been asked, “What is it that’s new, David, in the world of technology, communication, and information that’s causing so much stress?” My answer is pretty simple—“Nothing’s new except how frequently everything is new.” [Location 375](https://readwise.io/open/158156694) ^rw158156694
- You can’t really manage time; time just is. What you can manage is yourself— your focus and your actions. Time is what creates the awareness of constraint, which then forces the real issue, which involves where and when you allocate your resources. When you are fully and optimally self-managed, time actually disappears. You’re just engaged. There’s no sense of lack, conflict, or imbalance in your experience. [Location 393](https://readwise.io/open/158156695) ^rw158156695
- In recent years I have realized that everything I have uncovered and taught touches on some aspect of increasing control and perspective—no matter where, with whom, or under what circumstances. [Location 570](https://readwise.io/open/158156696) ^rw158156696
- If you can’t concentrate, it’s impossible to maximize your effectiveness in any activity, whether it’s playing the piano, breaking boards with your hands, trying to train your puppy, learning a language, or having an important conversation with your teenager.
