## Highlights
- It’s because perspective is everything. If you zoom in, you’ll start to see that in many cases, the temperature rises before the CO2 rises; sometimes between 800 and 1,000 years earlier. As geologist and paleoclimate expert Dr. Bob Carter puts it, to say that CO2 is the primary cause of temperature change is like saying that lung cancer causes smoking.

- Any global warming activist who isn’t a vegan is a hypocrite. [Location 263](https://readwise.io/open/158156761) ^rw158156761
- Implementing the emissions caps necessary theoretically to lower the temperature two degrees Celsius (which is the low end of the UN IPCC projections) would cost the world between $2.4 trillion and $26.5 trillion. What could we do with that $26.5 trillion instead? Oh, just the usual boring stuff like completely eliminating poverty, educating every child on the planet, and providing access to water and sanitation to everyone on earth for a century. After all that, we’d still have $21.9 trillion left to figure out how to spend. [Location 486](https://readwise.io/open/158156762) ^rw158156762
- That’s right, Jack. Every man is created equal. It’s what you do with it from there that makes the difference. We are all free agents in life. We make our own decisions. We control our own destiny. [Location 1499](https://readwise.io/open/158156763) ^rw158156763
- According to David Pimentel, a professor at the College of Agriculture at Cornell University, it takes about 1.29 gallons of gasoline to produce one gallon of ethanol. That’s like trying to get rich by spending $1.29 to buy a one-dollar bill. [Location 1903](https://readwise.io/open/158156764) ^rw158156764
- Because they know that Americans have the attention span of a cheerleader in an algebra class. [Location 2220](https://readwise.io/open/158156765) ^rw158156765
- We the People still have the ultimate voice in this country, and we can change our course by empowering those who not only stand for the truth but will fight for it. [Location 2294](https://readwise.io/open/158156766) ^rw158156766
- “Although [political correctness] arises from the laudable desire to sweep away the debris of racism and sexism and hatred, it replaces old prejudice with new ones. It declares certain topics off-limits, certain expressions off-limits, even certain gestures off-limits. “What began as a crusade for civility has soured into a cause of conflict and even censorship. Disputants treat sheer force—getting their foes punished or expelled, for instance—as a substitute for the power of ideas. “Throughout history, attempts to micromanage casual conversation have only incited distrust. They have invited people to look for an insult in every word, gesture, action. And, in their own Orwellian way, crusades that demand correct behavior crush diversity in the name of diversity.” [Location 2670](https://readwise.io/open/158156767) ^rw158156767
- When tipping becomes an expected part of the payment, service suffers. After all, why try harder when society has decided that you’re getting a tip anyway, with the default setting at 15 percent? When you start expecting a tip, you stop earning a tip. [Location 2897](https://readwise.io/open/158156768) ^rw158156768
