## Highlights
- As my daughter, the columnist Jackie Cushman, wrote, “We were told to vote for change we could believe in and found we had elected people who wanted to change what we believe.” [Location 109](https://readwise.io/open/158156754) ^rw158156754
- When wealthy aristocrats told Captain John Smith they did not have to work, he replied with a dictate reminiscent of St. Paul’s second epistle to the Thessalonians: “This is a new world and we can’t afford to carry people who won’t work. If you don’t work you won’t eat.” [Location 153](https://readwise.io/open/158156755) ^rw158156755
- The wall of separation these secularists seek to enforce is really one between the historic America and the radically different America they want to create—an America without God, traditional values, or knowledge of its own history. [Location 624](https://readwise.io/open/158156756) ^rw158156756
- Broadly defined, socialist policies favor increased central planning of the economy by politicians and bureaucrats instead of allowing entrepreneurs, businesses, and customers to make decisions in the free market. Socialists also favor government attempts to collectivize the means of production and to divvy up the national wealth. [Location 629](https://readwise.io/open/158156757) ^rw158156757
- “[The organizer] does not have a fixed truth—truth to him is relative and changing; everything to him is relative and changing. He is a political relativist.” [Location 704](https://readwise.io/open/158156758) ^rw158156758
