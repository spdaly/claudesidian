## Highlights
- What is called for is an exquisite balance between two conflicting needs: the most skeptical scrutiny of all hypotheses that are served up to us and at the same time a great openness to new ideas. [Location 336](https://readwise.io/open/158156207) ^rw158156207
- But focusing on what I put in my mouth is a key to health. As Cornell psychology professor Brian Wansink points out in his book Mindless Eating, one of the major causes of the obesity epidemic is that we thoughtlessly shove omnipresent food into always-open maws.

- It takes twenty minutes for the “I’m full” message to go from the stomach to the brain.) [Location 552](https://readwise.io/open/158156209) ^rw158156209

- “Well, it was about the sheer improbability that we even exist. The strange fact that out of millions of people in the world, your mother and father met and decided to get married to each other. And out of the millions of sperm, that the one with your genes was the one that made it to the egg and fertilized the egg. I’ll never forget it.” [Location 615](https://readwise.io/open/158156210) ^rw158156210
- Tart. The key to making healthy decisions is to respect your future self. Honor him or her. Treat him or her like you would treat a friend or a loved one. [Location 986](https://readwise.io/open/158156211) ^rw158156211
- belly flop. The real culprit isn’t fat. It’s carbohydrates—especially refined carbs. Here’s Taubes: “Insulin puts fat in fat cells. That’s what it does. And our insulin levels, for the most part, are determined by the carb-content of our diet—the quantity and quality of the carbohydrates consumed.” The more concentrated the sugar in our carbs, the more dangerous they are.

- Taubes and his camp recommend restricting carbs as much as possible, especially processed carbs, high-glycemic carbs (like bananas), and starchy carbs (like potatoes). Instead, they recommend eating more protein and good fats. They eat a lot of lean beef, eggs, fish, and all sorts of vegetables (spinach and broccoli, for instance). But little grain.

- Studies show that the more you pay attention to your body’s statistics, the greater the chance you’ll adopt a healthy lifestyle. This idea underpins the Quantified Self movement, in which adherents track everything from caloric output to selenium levels. [Location 1738](https://readwise.io/open/158156214) ^rw158156214
