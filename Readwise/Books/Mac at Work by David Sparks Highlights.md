## Highlights
- that I referenced only three mail locations: the inbox, the Action folder, and the archive. Everything else went to the trash. I just use three folders. [Location 1288](https://readwise.io/open/158156649) ^rw158156649
- Turn off the ding. Whatever e-mail client you use, disable the audio alert. It might be scary at first, but then it becomes liberating. [Location 1305](https://readwise.io/open/158156650) ^rw158156650
