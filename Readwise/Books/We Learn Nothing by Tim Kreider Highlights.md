## Highlights
- Because it turns out that you can blow life off for as long as you want, but you still have to take the finals. [Location 360](https://readwise.io/open/158156160) ^rw158156160
- The Soul Toupee is that thing about ourselves we are most deeply embarrassed by and like to think we have cunningly concealed from the world, but which is, in fact, pitifully obvious to everybody who knows us. [Location 532](https://readwise.io/open/158156161) ^rw158156161
- This is one reason people need to believe in God—because we want someone to know us, truly, all the way through, even the worst of us. [Location 589](https://readwise.io/open/158156162) ^rw158156162

- The Referendum is a phenomenon typical of (but not limited to) midlife, whereby people, increasingly aware of the finiteness of their time in the world, the limitations placed on them by their choices so far, and the narrowing options remaining to them, start judging their peers’ different choices with reactions ranging from envy to contempt. The Referendum can subtly poison formerly close and uncomplicated relationships, creating tensions between the married and the single, the childless and parents, careerists and the stay-at-home. It’s only exacerbated by the far greater range of options available to us now than even a few decades ago, when everyone had to follow the same drill: a job or housework, marriage, kids. So we’re all anxiously sizing up how everyone else’s decisions have worked out to reassure ourselves that our own are vindicated—that we are, in some sense, winning.
