- Jay and Vanessa, in joining your lives may God grant you both love to afford each other a special quality of time together; joy in the accomplishments of one another; understanding that your interests and desires will not always be the same; friendship based on mutual trust; courage to speak of a misunderstanding and to work on a solution before the sun sets; compassion to comfort each other in pain; mirth from each of your senses of humor; and awareness to live each day knowing there is no promise of tomorrow. May God bless you and keep you in the palm of His hand. Amen. [Location 1734](https://readwise.io/open/570474859) ^rw570474859
