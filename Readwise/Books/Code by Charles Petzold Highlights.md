## Highlights
- As we know, all matter—the stuff that we can see and feel (usually)—is made up of extremely small things called atoms. Every atom is composed of three types of particles; these are called neutrons, protons, and electrons. [Location 459](https://readwise.io/open/389966724) ^rw389966724
- The number of electrons in an atom is usually the same as the number of protons. But in certain circumstances, electrons can be dislodged from atoms. That’s how electricity happens. [Location 463](https://readwise.io/open/389966725) ^rw389966725
- Protons and electrons are happiest and most stable when they exist together in equal numbers. [Location 472](https://readwise.io/open/389966726) ^rw389966726
- The electricity in the circuit is the passage of electrons from atom to atom. [Location 481](https://readwise.io/open/389966727) ^rw389966727
- Batteries generate electricity through a chemical reaction. The chemicals in batteries are chosen so that the reactions between them generate spare electrons on the side of the battery marked with a minus sign (called the negative terminal, or anode) and demand extra electrons on the other side of the battery (the positive terminal, or cathode). [Location 486](https://readwise.io/open/473862462) ^rw473862462
- An atom that has just one electron in its outer shell can readily give up that electron, which is what’s necessary to carry electricity. These substances are conducive to carrying electricity and thus are said to be conductors. [Location 515](https://readwise.io/open/473862463) ^rw473862463
- Voltage refers to a potential for doing work. Voltage exists whether or not something is hooked up to a battery. [Location 528](https://readwise.io/open/389966730) ^rw389966730
- Current is similar to the amount of water flowing through a pipe. Voltage is similar to the water pressure. Resistance is similar to the width of a pipe—the smaller the pipe, the greater the resistance. [Location 536](https://readwise.io/open/389966731) ^rw389966731
