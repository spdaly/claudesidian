## Highlights
- AI is everywhere. It’s in our phones, cars, shopping experiences, romantic matchmaking, hospitals, banks, and all over the media. No wonder corporate directors, CEOs, vice presidents, managers, team leaders, entrepreneurs, investors, coaches, and policy makers are anxiously racing to learn about AI: they all realize it is about to fundamentally change their businesses [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/547585384) ^rw547585384
- Our first key insight is that the new wave of artificial intelligence does not actually bring us intelligence but instead a critical component of intelligence—prediction [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/547585443) ^rw547585443
- Economics provides a well-established foundation for understanding uncertainty and what it means for decision making. As better prediction reduces uncertainty, we use economics to tell you what AI means for the decisions you make in the course of your business [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/547585503) ^rw547585503
- The current wave of advances in artificial intelligence doesn’t actually bring us intelligence but instead a critical component of intelligence: prediction. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/547585528) ^rw547585528
- Prediction is a central input into decision-making. Economics has a well-developed framework for understanding decision-making. The new and poorly understood implications of advances in prediction technology can be combined with the old and well-understood logic of decision theory from economics to deliver a series of insights to help navigate your organization’s approach to AI. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/547585621) ^rw547585621
- There is often no single right answer to the question of which is the best AI strategy or the best set of AI tools, because AIs involve trade-offs: more speed, less accuracy; more autonomy, less control; more data, less privacy. We provide you with a method for identifying the trade-offs associated with each AI-related decision so that you can evaluate both sides of every trade in light of your organization’s mission and objectives and then make the decision that is best for you [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/547585637) ^rw547585637
- The technology itself is, simply put, amazing. Early on, famed venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson quipped: “Just about any product that you experience in the next five years that seems like magic will almost certainly be built by these algorithms.”[3](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/62227425`#`ch2en3) Jurvetson’s characterization of AI as “magical” resonated with the popular narrative of AI in films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, Blade Runner, and more recently Her, Transcendence, and Ex Machina. We understand and sympathize with Jurvetson’s characterization of AI applications as magical. As economists, our job is to take seemingly magical ideas and make them simple, clear, and practical. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/547585703) ^rw547585703
- Let’s start with the basics—prices. When the price of something falls, we use more of it. That’s simple economics and is happening right now with AI. AI is everywhere—packed into your phone’s apps, optimizing your electricity grids, and replacing your stock portfolio managers. Soon it may be driving you around or flying packages to your house.

- Consider the story of the commercial internet in 1995. While most of us were watching Seinfeld, Microsoft released Windows 95, its first multitasking operating system. That same year, the US government removed the final restrictions to carrying commercial traffic on the internet, and Netscape—the browser’s inventor—celebrated the first major initial public offering (IPO) of the commercial internet. This marked an inflection point when the internet transitioned from a technological curiosity to a commercial tidal wave that would wash over the economy. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/547585777) ^rw547585777
- Everyone began referring to the New Economy. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/547585798) ^rw547585798
- Everyone, that is, except economists [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/547585804) ^rw547585804
- Cheap Means Everywhere [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/547586067) ^rw547586067
- Prediction is the process of filling in missing information. Prediction takes information you have, often called “data,” and uses it to generate information you don’t have. Much discussion about AI emphasizes the variety of prediction techniques using increasingly obscure names and labels: classification, clustering, regression, decision trees, Bayesian estimation, neural networks, topological data analysis, deep learning, reinforcement learning, deep reinforcement learning, capsule networks, and so on. The techniques are important for technologists interested in implementing AI for a particular prediction problem. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/547586219) ^rw547586219
- Cheaper prediction will mean more predictions. This is simple economics: when the cost of something falls, we do more of it. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/547586263) ^rw547586263
- Predictions affect behavior. They influence decisions. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/551683845) ^rw551683845
- Despite its Latin root verb (praedicere, meaning to make known beforehand), our cultural understanding of prediction emphasizes the ability to see otherwise hidden information, whether in the past, present, or future. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/551685238) ^rw551685238
- PREDICTION is the process of filling in missing information. 
  Prediction takes information you have, often called “data,” 
  and uses it to generate information you don’t have. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/547586693) ^rw547586693
- The recent advances in AI, however, have enabled us to recast translation as a prediction problem. We can see the seemingly magical nature of the use of prediction for translation in the sudden [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/551685371) ^rw551685371
- By 2017, the vast majority of the thirty-eight teams did better than the human benchmark, and the best team had fewer than half as many mistakes. Machines could identify these types of images better than people [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/551689345) ^rw551689345
- The reason is because prediction is such a foundational input. You might not realize it, but predictions are everywhere. Our businesses and our personal lives are riddled with predictions. Often our predictions are hidden as inputs into decision making. Better prediction means better information, which means better decision making [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/547587934) ^rw547587934
- Better predictions lead to better outcomes, as we illustrated with the fraud-detection example [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/547588245) ^rw547588245
- What does regression do? It finds a prediction based on the average of what has occurred in the past. For instance, if all you have to go on to determine whether it is going to rain tomorrow is what happened each day last week, your best guess might be an average [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/551693713) ^rw551693713
- The financial crisis of 2008 was a spectacular failure of regression-based prediction methods. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/551701233) ^rw551701233
- The failure was not due to insufficient data, but instead how analysts used that data to form a prediction [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/551701319) ^rw551701319
- A key technology underpinning recent advances, labeled “deep learning,” relies on an approach called “back propagation.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/551704903) ^rw551704903
- Machine learning uses probabilistic models to solve problems. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/551705036) ^rw551705036
- Because the output of machine learning—prediction—is a key component of intelligence, the prediction accuracy improves by learning, and the high prediction accuracy often enables machines to perform tasks that, until now, were associated with human intelligence, such as object identification.

- Prediction is not just one of the things your brain does. It is the primary function of the neocortex, and the foundation of intelligence. The cortex is an organ of prediction [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/551705306) ^rw551705306
- Current AI algorithms cannot reason, and moreover it is difficult to interrogate them to understand the source of their predictions [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/551705338) ^rw551705338
- Many of the scholars’ aspirations at the 1956 Dartmouth conference are now within reach [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/551705361) ^rw551705361
- this progression from deterministic to probabilistic programming of computers is an important step-function transition, albeit consistent with progress in the social and physical sciences. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/551705386) ^rw551705386
- Hal Varian, the chief economist at Google, channeling Coca-Cola’s Robert Goizueta, said in 2013, “[A] billion hours ago, modern homo sapiens emerged. A billion minutes ago, Christianity began. A billion seconds ago, the IBM PC was released. A billion Google searches ago … was this morning. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/551705492) ^rw551705492 
- See also: [[quote]] 
- This data has value. Billions of searches mean billions of lines of data with which Google can improve its services. Some have called data “the new oil.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/551705507) ^rw551705507
- Prediction machines rely on data. More and better data leads to better predictions. In economic terms, data is a key complement to prediction. It becomes more valuable as prediction becomes cheaper. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/551705553) ^rw551705553 
- See also: [[quote]] [[ai]] 
- With AI, data plays three roles. First is input data, which is fed to the algorithm and used to produce a prediction. Second is training data, which is used to generate the algorithm in the first place. Training data is used to train the AI to become good enough to predict in the wild. Finally, there is feedback data, which is used to improve the algorithm’s performance with experience. In some situations, considerable overlap exists, such that the same data plays all three roles [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/551705587) ^rw551705587
- However, acquiring training data can be challenging. To predict the same group of items (in this case, heart patients), you need information on the outcome of interest (irregular heart rhythms) as well as information on something that will be useful for predicting that outcome in a new context (cardio-monitoring) [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/551706430) ^rw551706430
- Data is often costly to acquire, but prediction machines cannot operate without it. They require data to create, operate, and improve [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/551706544) ^rw551706544
- These tools are called “power calculations” and tell you how many units you need to analyze to generate a useful prediction [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/554229415) ^rw554229415
- In economist speak, data may have increasing or decreasing returns to scale [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/554229506) ^rw554229506
- From a purely statistical point of view, data has decreasing returns to scale. You get more useful information from the third observation than the hundredth, and you learn much more from the hundredth observation than the millionth. As you add observations to your training data, it becomes less and less useful to improving your prediction [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/554229568) ^rw554229568
- This might not be true from an economic point of view, which is not about how data improves prediction. It is about how data improves the value you get from the prediction. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/554229624) ^rw554229624
- Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld once said:
  There are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don’t know we don’t know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones.[9](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/62227425`#`ch6en9) [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/554233129) ^rw554233129

- This provides a useful structure for understanding the conditions under which prediction machines falter [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/554234065) ^rw554234065
- While computer scientists are working to reduce machines’ data needs, developing techniques such as “one-shot learning” in which machines learn to predict an object well after seeing it just once, current prediction machines are not yet adequate [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/554234566) ^rw554234566
- Nassim Nicholas Taleb emphasizes unknown unknowns in his book The Black Swan.[13](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/62227425`#`ch6en13) He highlights that we cannot predict truly new events from past data. The book’s title refers to the Europeans’ discovery of a new type of swan in Australia. To eighteenth-century Europeans, swans were white. Upon arrival in Australia, they saw something totally new and unpredictable: black swans. They had never seen black swans and therefore had no information that could predict the existence of such a swan.[14](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/62227425`#`ch6en14) Taleb argues that the appearances of other unknown unknowns have important consequences—unlike the appearance of black swans, which had little meaningful impact on the direction of European or Australian society.

- Perhaps the biggest weakness of prediction machines is that they sometimes provide wrong answers that they are confident are right [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/554236118) ^rw554236118
- The prediction comes with a confidence range that reveals its imprecision [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/555710013) ^rw555710013

- While this seemed like a victory for humanity, the researchers went further and combined the predictions of their algorithm and a pathologist’s. The result was an accuracy of 99.5 percent.[20](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/62227425`#`ch6en20) That is, the human error rate of 3.4 percent fell to just 0.5 percent. Errors fell by 85 percent. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/555710593) ^rw555710593
- the effect of the division of labour, both in mechanical and mental processes, is, that it enables us to purchase and apply precisely the quantity of skill and knowledge which is required for it.”[21](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/62227425`#`ch6en21) [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/555711303) ^rw555711303
- Note: The real opportunity isn't using prediction alone; it's using prediction along with human judgement.
- human and machine prediction overcame these weaknesses, so their combination dramatically reduced the error rate [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/555713935) ^rw555713935
- Machine prediction can enhance the productivity of human prediction via two broad pathways. The first is by providing an initial prediction that humans can use to combine with their own assessments. The second is to provide a second opinion after the fact, or a path for monitoring.

  Anatomy of a task
- The doctor’s judgment takes into account other data (including intuition and experience) [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/557745720) ^rw557745720
- By breaking up a decision into elements, we can think clearly about which parts of human activities will diminish in value and which will increase as a result of enhanced machine prediction [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/557745853) ^rw557745853
- But a key point is that, while prediction is a key component of any decision, it is not the only component. The other elements of a decision—judgment, data, and action—remain, for now, firmly in the realm of humans. They are complements to prediction, meaning they increase in value as prediction becomes cheap. For example, we may be more willing to exert effort by applying judgment to decisions where we previously had decided not to decide (e.g., accepted the default) because prediction machines now offer better, faster, and cheaper predictions. In that case, the demand for human judgment will increase [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/557745936) ^rw557745936
- Judgment is the process of determining the reward to a particular action in a particular environment. It is about working out the objective you’re actually pursuing. Judgment involves determining what we call the “reward function,” the relative rewards and penalties associated with taking particular actions that produce particular outcomes. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/557862504) ^rw557862504
- Prediction machines don’t provide judgment. Only humans do, because only humans can express the relative rewards from taking different actions. As AI takes over prediction, humans will do less of the combined prediction-judgment routine of decision making and focus more on the judgment role alone. This will enable an interactive interface between machine prediction and human judgment, much the same way that you run alternative queries when interacting with a spreadsheet or database [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/557862885) ^rw557862885
- Experience can sometimes make judgment codifiable. Much experience is intangible and so cannot be written down or expressed easily. As Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson wrote: “[S]ubstitution (of computers for people) is bounded because there are many tasks that people understand tacitly and accomplish effortlessly but for which neither computer programmers nor anyone else can enunciate the explicit ‘rules’ or procedures [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/575405788) ^rw575405788
- those predictions. Whether or not we can specify judgment in advance, someone needs to determine the judgment. Enter reward function engineering, the job of determining the rewards to various actions, given the predictions that the AI makes [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/575405876) ^rw575405876
