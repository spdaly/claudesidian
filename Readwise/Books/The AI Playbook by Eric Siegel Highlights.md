## Highlights
- There’s almost no business outcome that machine learning cannot help you improve today. From delivering a best-in-class customer and consumer experience to fueling productivity, increasing safety, optimizing operations, and improving your employee experience, ML can raise the bar on the metrics that matter across all. Its practical deployment represents the forefront of human progress: *improving operations with science*. But where do you start, and how do you ensure what you do start doesn’t end up in the dustbin? [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/674540324) ^rw674540324
- • **1. Start with outcomes in mind and focus on delivering value incrementally.**
  We started with a simple question: Could we increase the rate of decision making and execution to simplify the product portfolio—delivering savings while driving growth with our customers? Only after delivering on that scope and establishing that value did we expand to complete product portfolio optimization, including non-consumer facing simplification such as flagging specifications and ingredients to harmonize across products.
  • **2. Leverage empathy to overcome barriers to change.**
  Consciously or unconsciously, we are all preprogrammed to resist change. To overcome this, the analytics team spent hundreds of hours with other teams across the business to understand how portfolio decisions were being taken currently—including marketing, sales, supply chain, finance, research and development, and retailers. By gaining an understanding of the pain points in the current processes, we were able to bring forward a compelling value proposition for stakeholders across levels and functions.
  • **3. Prepare the data so that it meets business needs.**
  Only by anticipating early the differences in data availability, due to the global nature of our business, did the team succeed in scaling the capability across geographies. We recognized that we had to adapt to variations of data across markets—some of which were rich with retailer and third-party data illuminating shopper behavior patterns, while others held inconsistent point of sale and shopper information based on the route to market. A versatile data infrastructure and stringent data validation process were key to success. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/674540414) ^rw674540414

- Note: Guidelines for approaching large AI initiatives
- Never sell AI. Instead, pitch operational improvements, with no more than a footnote to mention machine learning as part of the solution. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/674541141) ^rw674541141

- Most ML leaders focus more on the technology than its deployment, so most new ML initiatives fail. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/674542684) ^rw674542684
- Machine learning: Technology that learns from experience (data) to predict the outcome or behavior of each customer, patient, package delivery, business, vehicle, image, piece of equipment, or other individual unit—in order to drive better operational decisions. ML generates a *predictive model* whose job is to calculate a *predictive score* (probability) for each individual. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/674543123) ^rw674543123
- The ML industry has bitten forbidden fruit: It has chosen to promote itself as *AI*, an ill-defined umbrella term that includes ML within its malleable scope. This tends to mislead, especially when discussing a more typical, practical ML initiative designed to improve business operations and not, for example, meant to generate humanlike writing or to achieve human-level “intelligence.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/674633832) ^rw674633832
- AI alludes to “intelligence,” which is stubbornly nebulous when describing a technology, the term tends to overstate and fetishize rather than pitching the technology’s concrete value. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/674634222) ^rw674634222
- Glamorizing the core technology takes the focus off its concrete value, the specific way its deployment can improve operations. When that deployment isn’t central to the plan, the plan is unlikely to come to fruition. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/674634239) ^rw674634239
- The best [ML] use cases for big business are, frankly, the most mundane ones.

- In fact, he didn’t even call it *ML*, *predictive analytics*, or *data science*. Instead, he went with just about the most boring word there is for it: *operations research*. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/702197964) ^rw702197964
- In a system as complex as UPS’s internal package network, uncertainty is an inherent predicament. The antidote is prediction. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/704192511) ^rw704192511
- Businesses and other organizations need prediction. Prediction requires ML. And ML depends on data. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/704192699) ^rw704192699
- We have data, we give it to ML, it makes models that predict, and we use the predictions to drive operations more optimally. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/704193503) ^rw704193503
- “I really am proud that, instead of a trucking company with technology,” he says, “we’re now a technology company with trucks.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/704194060) ^rw704194060
- It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness.
  —Charles Dickens [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/704194460) ^rw704194460
- On the one hand, ML is “the most important general-purpose technology of our era,” as *Harvard Business Review* astutely put it. On the other hand, it’s the most misunderstood and mismanaged. Misfire after misfire, many ML projects go amiss in their mission to deploy, their models destined only to collect dust. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/704194477) ^rw704194477

- Jack Levis had once said: “The business drives technology; the technology doesn’t drive the business.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/763730422) ^rw763730422
- Individual use of technology does not always translate into knowing how to use these tools effectively within or as an organization.

- Statisticians, like artists, have the bad habit of falling in love with their models.
  —Famed statistics professor George Box [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/763730594) ^rw763730594
- Most analytics and AI projects fail because operationalization is only addressed as an afterthought.

- The six steps of bizML:
  1. 1. *Value: Establish the deployment goal*. This step defines the business value proposition: how ML will affect operations in order to improve them by way of the final step, model deployment.
  2. 2. *Target: Establish the prediction goal*. This step defines exactly what the model will predict for each individual case. Each detail of this matters from a business perspective.
  3. 3. *Performance: Establish the evaluation metrics*. This step defines which measures matter the most and what performance level must be achieved—how well the model must predict—for project success.
  4. 4. *Fuel: Prepare the data*. This step defines what the data must look like and gets it into that form.
  5. 5. *Algorithm: Train the model*. This step generates a predictive model from the data. The model is the thing that’s “learned.”
  6. 6. *Launch: Deploy the model*. This step uses the model to render predictions (probabilities)—thereby applying what’s been learned to new cases—and then acts on those predictions to improve business operations. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/763730711) ^rw763730711
