## Highlights
- A man on foot, on horseback or on a bicycle will see more, feel more, enjoy more in one mile than the motorized tourists can in a hundred miles. —Edward Abbey, Desert Solitaire [Location 349](https://readwise.io/open/298773832) ^rw298773832
- One of my favorite things to do, no matter where I am, is to locomote my hirsute bod to a location like this, sit down, maybe enjoy a cup of black coffee or tea from my thermos, and listen. This is a pursuit that really doesn’t get enough play on our modern corporate-driven channels. You rarely see messaging encouraging one to sit still, breathe, and please don’t think about buying anything at all. [Location 655](https://readwise.io/open/298873665) ^rw298873665
- We have allowed our food system to be entirely usurped by corporate interests who do not produce our food with our health in mind. Think about that. I mean, what is the point of food in the first place? In America, the obfuscation cloaking how our food is produced has reached the point where we have to work hard just to discern which food is actually clean, healthy, nutritious, and free of additives, and then pay considerably more to buy it.

- I should point out that the farmers themselves, from large to small, are not the villains here, but simply participants in a deeply flawed system that is perpetuated by faceless corporate entities. Farming successfully on any level is extremely difficult. [Location 1771](https://readwise.io/open/307679378) ^rw307679378
