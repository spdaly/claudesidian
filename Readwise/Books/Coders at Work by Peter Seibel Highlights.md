## Highlights
- Zawinski: Yeah. At the end of the day, ship the fucking thing! It's great to rewrite your code and make it cleaner and by the third time it'll actually be pretty. But that's not the point-you're not here to write code; you're here to ship products. [Location 328](https://readwise.io/open/158156708) ^rw158156708
- I think one thing that's really important is to not be afraid of your ignorance. If you don't understand how something works, ask someone who does. A lot of people are skittish about that. And that doesn't help anybody. Not knowing something doesn't mean you're dumb-it just means you don't know it yet. [Location 551](https://readwise.io/open/158156709) ^rw158156709
