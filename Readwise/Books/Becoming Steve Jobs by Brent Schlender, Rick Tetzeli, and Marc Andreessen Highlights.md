## Highlights
- “When we screwed up,” says Catmull, “it wasn’t, ‘Oh, you guys screwed up!’ It was always, ‘What are we going to do to move forward?’ When you’re out there on the edge, some things go right and some things go wrong. If nothing’s going wrong, you’re fooling yourself. [Location 2852](https://readwise.io/open/158156425) ^rw158156425
- He was more open to the talent of others, to be inspired by and challenged by that talent, but also to the idea of inspiring them to do amazing things he knew he couldn’t do himself.” [Location 2862](https://readwise.io/open/158156426) ^rw158156426

- For a lot of people, their egos are tied up in an idea and it gets in the way of learning. You have to separate yourself from the idea. Steve was like that.” [Location 2882](https://readwise.io/open/158156427) ^rw158156427
- Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. [Location 3602](https://readwise.io/open/158156428) ^rw158156428

- willingness to not be governed by the release date. It’s not about how fast you do something, it’s about doing your level best. [Location 4652](https://readwise.io/open/158156430) ^rw158156430
- Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only [Location 5236](https://readwise.io/open/158156431) ^rw158156431
- connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something—your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life. [Location 5237](https://readwise.io/open/158156432) ^rw158156432
- Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith. [Location 5258](https://readwise.io/open/158156433) ^rw158156433
- Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma—which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.

- Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. [Location 5300](https://readwise.io/open/158156435) ^rw158156435
- “We all get crushed or decked or knocked down. Everyone does. Sometimes you may not even see [Location 5314](https://readwise.io/open/158156436) ^rw158156436
- that it’s happened, but it happens to everyone,” [Location 5314](https://readwise.io/open/158156437) ^rw158156437
- “Number one, you have to deliver superior financial results. Number two, you have to make a distinctive impact, to the point where if you didn’t exist you couldn’t be easily replaced. Number three, the company must have lasting endurance, beyond [Location 6665](https://readwise.io/open/158156438) ^rw158156438
- multiple generations of technology, markets, and cycles, and it must demonstrate the ability to do this beyond a single leader. [Location 6667](https://readwise.io/open/158156439) ^rw158156439
