## Highlights
- America, he said, has become "a food fun house ... a carnival of delicious, fatty, salty, sugary, and, more to the point, accessible and cheap delights. How could you expect to go to the carnival and not want to go on the rides? It's bright and colorful and fun and exciting. There are all these pings and noises. Of course you want to go on a ride; of course you want to play the game; of course you want to spend your money on this stimulation." [Location 97](https://readwise.io/open/158156726) ^rw158156726
- Most people do a poor job of reporting what they eat, and overweight people are particularly inaccurate reporters. So much of our eating takes place outside our awareness that it's easy to underestimate how much food we actually put into our bodies. [Location 172](https://readwise.io/open/158156727) ^rw158156727
- The research confirmed that people tend to substantially underestimate their food intake, a finding that was apparent in both groups of study subjects. But it also showed an obvious and dramatic contrast between the two groups-the weight gainers ate an average of almost 400 calories a day more than the comparison group. At that rate, they stood to put on more than two pounds every three weeks. [Location 178](https://readwise.io/open/158156728) ^rw158156728
- the weight of their parents and the amount of energy the children burned were less important factors than their caloric intake. The children who ate more weighed more. [Location 181](https://readwise.io/open/158156729) ^rw158156729
- How much we eat predicts how much we weigh. Sometimes the most obvious explanation turns out to be the right one. [Location 184](https://readwise.io/open/158156730) ^rw158156730
- Like the homeostatic system, the body's reward system is essential to survival, encouraging us to seek out pleasurable things like sex and food. Powerful biological forces are at play that make us want something enough to pursue it and then make us feel momentarily better once we obtain it. The anticipation of reward provides motivation to act. [Location 205](https://readwise.io/open/158156731) ^rw158156731
- In everyday language, we call food palatable if it has an agreeable taste. But when scientists say a food is palatable, they are referring primarily to its capacity to stimulate the appetite and prompt us to eat more. Palatability does involve taste, of course, but, crucially, it also involves the motivation to pursue that taste. It is the reason we want more. [Location 217](https://readwise.io/open/158156732) ^rw158156732
- Fat, he wrote, "is responsible for the characteristic texture, flavor, and aroma of many foods and largely determines the palatability of the diet." [Location 229](https://readwise.io/open/158156733) ^rw158156733
- The combination of sugar and fat is what people prefer, and it's what they'll eat most. The art of pleasing the palate is in large part a matter of combining them in optimal amounts. That can do more than make food palatable. It can make food "hyperpalatable." [Location 237](https://readwise.io/open/158156734) ^rw158156734
- Eating foods high in sugar, fat, and salt makes us eat more foods high insugar, fat, and salt. We see this clearly in both animal and human research. [Location 245](https://readwise.io/open/158156735) ^rw158156735
