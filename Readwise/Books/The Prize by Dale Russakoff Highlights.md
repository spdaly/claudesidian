## Highlights
- Zuckerberg made clear that his primary goal was to find a way to attract, nurture, and handsomely reward top teachers. Like almost every school district in the country, Newark paid teachers based on how long they had held their jobs and how many graduate degrees they had earned, although neither correlated with increased effectiveness. In other words, teachers who transformed students’ lives received the same pay as the deadwood. “Who would want to work in a system like that?” Zuckerberg wondered aloud about circumstances that applied to almost all of America’s 3.3 million public school teachers.

- STAY FOCUSED AND KEEP SHIPPING. MOVE FAST AND BREAK THINGS. DONE IS BETTER THAN PERFECT. WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WEREN’T AFRAID? [Location 440](https://readwise.io/open/158156412) ^rw158156412
- The going rate for consultants in Newark and elsewhere on the East Coast was $1,000 a day, and their pay comprised more than $20 million of the $200 million in philanthropy spent or committed in Newark. “Everyone’s getting paid, but Raheem still can’t read,” [Location 1085](https://readwise.io/open/158156413) ^rw158156413

- “This is the DNA of the city,” Price said. “Even if there’s no evidence of conspiracy, there’s the ability to imagine one.” [Location 1150](https://readwise.io/open/158156414) ^rw158156414

- From three thousand miles away, Zuckerberg and Sandberg were alarmed. Six months had passed since the Oprah announcement, and the quest for a model of transformational urban education appeared in real danger of coming apart amid leaks, political deals, public rancor, and mismanagement.

- “I’m thinking, ‘Do everything you can right now, instead of worrying what tomorrow will be like or the next day,’” Booker said. “Right now, if TEAM [the charter network] expands another school, if you add another school model, if you expand the school day, if you change the life of one kid, today you can do something—right now. People allow their inability to control everything to undermine their determination to do something.” [Location 1519](https://readwise.io/open/158156416) ^rw158156416

- Zuckerberg and Sandberg summoned the mayor to a meeting at Facebook headquarters on Saturday afternoon, April 2, where they made it clear they considered the pace of progress unacceptable. There was no superstar superintendent, no comprehensive reform plan, no progress toward a game-changing teachers’ contract. If these are the wrong metrics for measuring progress, they asked, what are the right ones? [Location 1532](https://readwise.io/open/158156417) ^rw158156417

- where a core group of union and grassroots activists denounced every proposed reform as a conspiracy of the mayor and governor against the interests of Newark’s children. [Location 1546](https://readwise.io/open/158156418) ^rw158156418

- “We’re acting like Bloods versus Crips, charters versus district. That’s a gangster mentality,” he said gravely. “We need to educate our children. It is [Location 1560](https://readwise.io/open/158156419) ^rw158156419

- Surprisingly, Cerf, Booker, and Christie had no plan for ensuring a stable learning environment for children in district schools as they advocated aggressive expansion of charters. [Location 1779](https://readwise.io/open/158156422) ^rw158156422

- Christie had not funded the full formula since taking office, citing the state fiscal crisis, but the allocation was still equivalent to about $20,000 per student. Less than half of this, though, reached district schools to pay teachers, social workers, counselors, classroom aides, secretaries, and administrators—the people who actually delivered education to children. The rest went into the central bureaucracy, which technically served students but at huge cost. [Location 2034](https://readwise.io/open/158156424) ^rw158156424
