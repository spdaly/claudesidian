- Artificial Intelligence (AI) is having a transformational impact on business. From product design and financial modeling to performance management and marketing spending, AI and machine learning are becoming everyday tools for managers in organizations of all sizes.

- *feature extraction*, which determines what data to use in the model; [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/535778618) ^rw535778618
- *regularization*, which determines how the data is weighted within the model [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/535778641) ^rw535778641
- *cross-validation*, which tests the accuracy of the model [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/535778648) ^rw535778648
- Feature Extraction
  Think of feature extraction as the process of figuring out what variables the model will use. Sometimes this can simply mean dumping all the raw data straight in, but many machine learning techniques can build new variables—called “features”—which can aggregate important signals that are spread out over many variables in the raw data.

- In prediction problems, however, causality isn’t a priority: Instead we’re trying to optimize a decision that depends on a stable environment. In fact, the more stable an environment, the more useful a prediction model will be. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/665542942) ^rw665542942
