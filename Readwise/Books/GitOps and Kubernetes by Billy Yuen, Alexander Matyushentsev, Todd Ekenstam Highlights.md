## Highlights
- Kubernetes is a massively popular open source platform that orchestrates and automates operations. [None](https://readwise.io/open/722685809) ^rw722685809
- Git is the most widely used version-control system in the software industry today. [None](https://readwise.io/open/722685810) ^rw722685810
- GitOps is a set of procedures that uses the power of Git to provide both revision and change control within the Kubernetes platform. [None](https://readwise.io/open/722685811) ^rw722685811
- GitOps brings the core benefits of Infrastructure as Code and immutable infrastructure to the deployment, monitoring, and life-cycle management of Kubernetes applications in an intuitive, accessible way. [None](https://readwise.io/open/722685812) ^rw722685812
- Two everyday tasks in managing and operating computer systems are infrastructure configuration and software deployment. [None](https://readwise.io/open/722685813) ^rw722685813
- Infrastructure configuration prepares computing resources (such as servers, storage, and load balancers) that enable the software application to operate correctly. [None](https://readwise.io/open/722685814) ^rw722685814
- Software deployment is the process of taking a particular version of a software application and making it ready to run on the computing infrastructure [None](https://readwise.io/open/722685815) ^rw722685815
- Because three teams are involved, often with different management-reporting structures, a detailed handoff process and thorough documentation of the application changes are needed to ensure that the application is adequately tested, appropriate changes are made to infrastructure, and the application is installed correctly. [None](https://readwise.io/open/722685816) ^rw722685816
- These requirements, however, cause deployments to take a long time and reduce the frequency at which deployments can be made. Also, with each transition between teams, the possibility that essential details will not being communicated increases, possibly leading to gaps in testing or incorrect deployment. [None](https://readwise.io/open/722685817) ^rw722685817 
- See also: [[green]] 
- DevOps is both an organizational structure and a mindset change with an emphasis on automation. [None](https://readwise.io/open/722685818) ^rw722685818
- In a GitOps model, the systemâ€™s desired configuration is stored in a revision control system, such as Git. [None](https://readwise.io/open/722685819) ^rw722685819
