## Highlights
- I INHERITED FROM my father a peculiar form of indolence—not outright laziness so much as a gift for avoiding unpleasant chores without attracting public notice. My father took it almost as a matter of principle that most problems, if ignored, simply went away. [Location 44](https://readwise.io/open/158156740) ^rw158156740
- Here is the central mystery of fatherhood, or at any rate my experience of it. How does a man’s resentment of this…thing…that lands in his life and instantly disrupts every aspect of it for the apparent worse turn into love? A month after Quinn was born, I would have felt only an obligatory sadness if she had been rolled over by a truck. Six months or so later, I’d have thrown myself in front of the truck to save her from harm. What happened? What transformed me from a monster into a father? I do not know. But this time around I’m keeping a closer eye on the process. [Location 625](https://readwise.io/open/158156741) ^rw158156741
- THE FIRST RULE of fatherhood is that if you don’t see what the problem is, you are the problem. [Location 659](https://readwise.io/open/158156742) ^rw158156742
- THE SECOND RULE of fatherhood is that if everyone in the room is laughing, and you don’t know what they’re laughing about, they are laughing about you. [Location 798](https://readwise.io/open/158156743) ^rw158156743
- A family is like a stereo system: A stereo system is only as good as its weakest component, and a family is only as happy as its unhappiest member. [Location 1178](https://readwise.io/open/158156744) ^rw158156744
- I’d count all my blessings, but I’d run out of fingers, so I stick with the big ones. [Location 1182](https://readwise.io/open/158156745) ^rw158156745
