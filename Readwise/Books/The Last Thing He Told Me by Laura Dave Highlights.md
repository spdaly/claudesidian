## Highlights
- I have little patience with scientists who take a board of wood, look for its thinnest part, and drill a great number of holes where drilling is easy. —Albert Einstein [Location 43](https://readwise.io/open/296840403) ^rw296840403
- Watching my grandfather work taught me that not everything was fluid. There were certain things that you hit from different angles, but you never gave up on. You did the work that was needed, wherever that work took you. [Location 117](https://readwise.io/open/297524447) ^rw297524447
