## Highlights
- Wide acceptance of an idea is not proof of its validity. [Location 1801](https://readwise.io/open/158156720) ^rw158156720
- Sin-cere. Since the days of Michelangelo, sculptors had been hiding the flaws in their work by smearing hot wax into the cracks and then dabbing the wax with stone dust. The method was considered cheating, and therefore, any sculpture “without wax”—literally sine cera—was considered a “sincere” piece of art. The phrase stuck. To this day we still sign our letters “sincerely” as a promise that we have written “without wax” and that our words are true. [Location 7657](https://readwise.io/open/158156721) ^rw158156721
