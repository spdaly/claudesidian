## Highlights
- The addicted were now termed “junkies,” inner-city users who supported their habit by collecting and selling scrap metal. [Location 384](https://readwise.io/open/839630818) ^rw839630818
- The advent of the pain score, we now think, got patients used to the idea that zero pain was the goal, whereas now doctors focus more on function if the pain score is three or four.” [Location 436](https://readwise.io/open/839630819) ^rw839630819
- Compared with the New Zealand hospitals where Davis worked earlier in his career—often prescribing physical therapy, anti-inflammatories, biofeedback, or acupuncture as a first-line measure—American insurance companies in the age of managed care were more likely to cover opioid pills, which were not only cheaper but also considered a much quicker fix. [Location 437](https://readwise.io/open/839630820) ^rw839630820
- Little did Davis or the other ER docs understand that the routine practice of sending patients home with a two-week supply of oxycodone or hydrocodone would culminate by the year 2017 in a financial toll of $1 trillion as measured in lost productivity and increased health care, social services, education, and law enforcement costs.

- “It’s just nuts. Because if we really believe that addiction is a result of changes in the brain due to chronic heavy drug exposure, how can we believe that stimulant exposure isn’t going to change these kids’ brains in a way that makes them more vulnerable to harder drugs?” she added.
