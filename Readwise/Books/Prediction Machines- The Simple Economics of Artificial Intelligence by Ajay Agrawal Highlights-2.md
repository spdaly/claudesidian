## Highlights
- Our first key insight is that the new wave of artificial intelligence does not actually
  bring us intelligence but instead a critical component of intelligence—prediction [None](https://readwise.io/open/722685821) ^rw722685821
- Tim Bresnahan, a Stanford economist and one of our mentors, pointed out that computers
  do arithmetic and nothing more. The advent and commercialization of computers made
  arithmetic cheap [None](https://readwise.io/open/722685822) ^rw722685822
- Prediction is the process of filling in missing information [None](https://readwise.io/open/722685823) ^rw722685823
- Prediction takes information
  you have, often called “data,” and uses it to generate information you don’t have [None](https://readwise.io/open/722685824) ^rw722685824
- Cheaper prediction will mean more predictions. This is simple economics: when the
  cost of something falls, we do more of it [None](https://readwise.io/open/722685825) ^rw722685825
- The same goes for prediction. Prediction is being used for traditional tasks, like
  inventory management and demand forecasting. More significantly, because it is becoming
  cheaper it is being used for problems that were not traditionally prediction problems [None](https://readwise.io/open/722685826) ^rw722685826
- Too many things could happen—too many “ifs” to possibly
  code. [None](https://readwise.io/open/722685827) ^rw722685827
- Critically, when an input such as prediction becomes cheap, this can enhance the value
  of other things. Economists call these “complements. [None](https://readwise.io/open/722685828) ^rw722685828
