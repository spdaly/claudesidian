## Highlights
- “Smart conservatives know that you can’t stop change but you can slow it down. That way people have time to get used to new ideas, and you don’t suffer an angry reaction. Liberals make the mistake of demanding radical change now, and that undermines them.” [Location 1031](https://readwise.io/open/389967077) ^rw389967077
