## Highlights
- I’m improbably successful in the comedy world. You don’t know the full scope of it, but it’s almost unimaginable. I’m not telling you that to brag. I’m saying it because I’m really not special. I wasn’t chosen, and I didn’t have a team of tastemakers behind me making my dreams happen. I made them happen, and you can make yours happen too. I mean it. If you’re a comedian, writer, actor, painter, director, dancer, or any other type of artist, you can make your dreams happen. You can have the career and the life that you dream of. The only thing I did was believe I could do it, and I took action. You must do the same. You have to know you are meant to do your craft and you have to act. You have to write, dance, paint, get onstage, express yourself however you feel compelled to, and you have to take a chance on yourself. I recorded my own album, submitted for what was available, and started my own podcast. I’m not special, but I didn’t wait for something to happen. I took calculated risks, and you can and should do the same. Make the life you want happen [Location 2010](https://readwise.io/open/570474873) ^rw570474873
