## Highlights
- No business can do well for its shareholders without first doing well by all the people its business touches. [Location 112](https://readwise.io/open/158156651) ^rw158156651
- There are moments in our lives when we summon the courage to make choices that go against reason, against common sense and the wise counsel of people we trust. But we lean forward nonetheless because, despite all risks and rational argument, we believe that the path we are choosing is the right and best thing to do. We refuse to be bystanders, even if we do not know exactly where our actions will lead. [Location 223](https://readwise.io/open/158156652) ^rw158156652
- “Life is a sum of all your choices,” wrote Albert Camus. Large or small, our actions forge our futures, hopefully inspiring others along the way. [Location 228](https://readwise.io/open/158156653) ^rw158156653
- Work should be personal. For all of us. Not just for the artist and the entrepreneur. Work should have meaning for the accountant, the construction worker, the technologist, the manager, and the clerk. Infusing work with purpose and meaning, however, is a two-way street. Yes, love what you do, but your company should love you back. [Location 352](https://readwise.io/open/158156654) ^rw158156654
- creating an engaging, respectful, trusting workplace culture is not the result of any one thing. It's a combination of intent, process, and heart, a trio that must constantly be fine-tuned. [Location 367](https://readwise.io/open/158156655) ^rw158156655
- A well-built brand is the culmination of intangibles that do not directly flow to the revenue or profitability of a company, but contribute to its texture. Forsaking them can take a subtle, collective toll. [Location 528](https://readwise.io/open/158156656) ^rw158156656
- The merchant's success depends on his or her ability to tell a story. What people see or hear or smell or do when they enter a space guides their feelings, enticing them to celebrate whatever the seller has to offer. [Location 727](https://readwise.io/open/158156657) ^rw158156657
- Mike Ullman, our lead director and an experienced CEO, has said that communication is always important, but it is even more essential when things are not working. [Location 1808](https://readwise.io/open/158156658) ^rw158156658
- Success is not sustainable if it's defined by how big you become. [Location 2831](https://readwise.io/open/158156659) ^rw158156659
