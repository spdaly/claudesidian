## Highlights
- General George Patton quote: “Don’t tell people how to do things, tell them what you need done and let them surprise you with their results.” [Location 15](https://readwise.io/open/158156348) ^rw158156348
- It’s that ideas are easier to come up with than you think. What’s hard — really hard— is moving from an idea to reality. It’s hard to find the right form of an idea, a form that will let consumers see its value, understand how to interact [Location 42](https://readwise.io/open/158156349) ^rw158156349
- One: set inspiring and measurable goals. Two: make sure you and your team are always making progress toward that desired end state. No matter how many other things are on your plate. And three: set a cadence that makes sure the group both remembers what they are trying to accomplish and holds each other accountable. [Location 52](https://readwise.io/open/158156350) ^rw158156350

- Starting every week with a public setting of priorities is powerful. You commit to the team and to each other to make the Objective occur. A Friday celebration of what’s been accomplished is the second bookend of a high-performing team’s week. This commit/celebrate cadence creates a habit of execution.
