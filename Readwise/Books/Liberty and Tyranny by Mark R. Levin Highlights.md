## Highlights
- Prudence is the highest virtue for it is judgment drawn on wisdom. [Location 220](https://readwise.io/open/158156352) ^rw158156352
- Sunstein believes that economic value and private property are not natural occurrences in human interaction but rather the outgrowth of government and law. Therefore, he and other legal “realists” assert that government authority should be used to better exploit and redistribute wealth. [Location 584](https://readwise.io/open/158156353) ^rw158156353
- The federal government cannot possibly comprehend the diversity of interests that are affected by its decision making. It cannot adequately weigh the costs and benefits of its decisions on communities. Besides, that is not its purpose. It seeks to dictate rather than represent. [Location 661](https://readwise.io/open/158156354) ^rw158156354
- The Statist has also constructed a Fourth Branch of government—an enormous administrative state—which exists to oversee and implement his policies. [Location 713](https://readwise.io/open/158156355) ^rw158156355
- Conservative believes that the federal government should raise revenue only to fund those activities that the Constitution authorizes and no others. [Location 813](https://readwise.io/open/158156356) ^rw158156356
- A recent study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that when measuring household taxes (income taxes and employee Social Security contributions), the United States “has the most progressive tax system and collects the largest share of taxes from the richest 10 percent of the population,” placing a heavier tax burden on high-income households than other industrialized nations do.2 The latest Congressional Budget Office figures show that the top 1 percent of income earners in the United States paid 39 percent of federal income taxes while earning 18 percent of pretax income and the top 5 percent of income earners paid 61 percent of federal income taxes while earning 31 percent of pretax income. Indeed, the top 40 percent of income earners paid 99.4 percent of federal income taxes. The bottom 40 percent of income earners paid no federal income tax and received 3.8 percent from the tax system. And the middle 20 percent of income earners pay only 4.4 percent of federal income taxes.3 [Location 825](https://readwise.io/open/158156357) ^rw158156357
- Redistributing wealth is a central objective of the progressive income tax, which Marx would endorse and Smith would reject. For the Statist, there must be a class struggle and it must be a never-ending struggle, for it is perhaps his most valuable weapon in his war against the individual, the free market, and ultimately the civil society. [Location 835](https://readwise.io/open/158156358) ^rw158156358
- The free market is, therefore, said to be incapable of serving the public interest, for it produces unjust results, thereby requiring further government intervention. [Location 841](https://readwise.io/open/158156359) ^rw158156359
- The reason stimulus plans of this sort do not work is a fundamental reality of governance: The government does not add value to the economy. It removes value from the economy by imposing taxes on one citizen and providing cash to another. [Location 1184](https://readwise.io/open/158156360) ^rw158156360
- Of course, the best way to stimulate the economy would be for the federal government to slash capital gains taxes, corporate income taxes, and individual income tax rates, thereby increasing liquidity available to individuals and businesses to make decisions about their own economic circumstances.

- Inc in California—report that it cooled by about 0.7C in 2007. This is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back where we were in 1930. If the temperature does not soon recover, we will have to conclude that global warming is over.”67 [Location 1809](https://readwise.io/open/158156362) ^rw158156362
- But the stampede continues. And the solution is the innocuous-sounding “cap and trade” proposal. For the Conservative, this is the most oppressive economic scheme yet to be advanced by the Statist. The way it would work is that the federal government would dictate greenhouse gas emission levels, with emphasis on carbon dioxide, from fossil fuel use. In a relatively short period of time, the government [Location 1819](https://readwise.io/open/158156363) ^rw158156363
- Moreover, rather than Americanize aliens and use public and private institutions to inculcate them with the virtues of American culture, language, mores, history, traditions, and customs, the Statist is cultivating a cultural relativism in which the cultures from which the aliens fled are given equal accord with the American culture. But all cultures are not equal, as evidenced, in part, by the alien fleeing his own country for the American culture and the American citizen staying put. [Location 2124](https://readwise.io/open/158156364) ^rw158156364
- St. Augustine observed: “When men cannot communicate their thoughts to each other, simply because of difference of language, all the similarity of their common human nature is of no avail to unite them in fellowship.”29 Alexis de Tocqueville made the same point: “Language is perhaps the strongest, perhaps most enduring link which unites men.”30 [Location 2149](https://readwise.io/open/158156365) ^rw158156365
- a modern economy with growing emphasis on education and higher skills, the surplus of unskilled foreign labor will further strain and expand social services while keeping wages low for those who find entry-level and low-skill jobs. [Location 2208](https://readwise.io/open/158156366) ^rw158156366
- Robert Rector notes, “In FY 2004, low-skill immigrant households received $30,160 per household in immediate [government] benefits and services (direct benefits, means-tested benefits, education, and population-based services). In general, low-skill immigrant households received about $10,000 more in government benefits than did the average U.S. household, largely because of the higher level of means-tested welfare benefits received by low-skill immigrant households. In contrast, low-skill immigrant households paid only $10,573 in taxes in 2004. Thus, low-skill immigrant households received nearly three dollars in immediate benefits and services for each dollar in taxes paid.”41 [Location 2217](https://readwise.io/open/158156367) ^rw158156367
- Eugene McCarthy wrote, “The United States cannot regain its competitive standing in the world by importing low wage workers from other countries. On the one hand, it engenders conditions this country cannot and should not tolerate…. On the other hand, in the modern age a nation’s wealth and prosperity is secured by high worker productivity and capital investment, not by the availability of low-wage labor.”42 [Location 2222](https://readwise.io/open/158156368) ^rw158156368
- extraterritorial nationalism among its citizens—that is, the notion that Mexican citizens have an indigenous claim to large swaths of the United States. On July 23, 1997, Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo declared that “I have proudly affirmed that the Mexican nation extends beyond the territory enclosed by its borders [the southwestern United States] and that Mexican migrants are an important—a very important—part of it.”51 [Location 2261](https://readwise.io/open/158156369) ^rw158156369
