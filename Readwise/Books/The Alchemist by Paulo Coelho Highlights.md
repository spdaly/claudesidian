- “I’m like everyone else—I see the world in terms of what I would like to see happen, not what actually does.” [Location 522](https://readwise.io/open/198801150) ^rw198801150

- “Because I don’t live in either my past or my future. I’m interested only in the present. If you can concentrate always on the present, you’ll be a happy man.
