## Highlights
- To be steady while the world spins around you. To act without frenzy. To hear only what needs to be heard. To possess quietude—exterior and interior—on command. [Location 134](https://readwise.io/open/833775037) ^rw833775037
- “All of humanity’s problems,” Blaise Pascal said in 1654, “stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.” [Location 152](https://readwise.io/open/833775038) ^rw833775038
- Stillness is what aims the archer’s arrow. It inspires new ideas. It sharpens perspective and illuminates connections. It slows the ball down so that we might hit it. It generates a vision, helps us resist the passions of the mob, makes space for gratitude and wonder. Stillness allows us to persevere. To succeed. It is the key that unlocks the insights of genius, and allows us regular folks to understand them. [Location 159](https://readwise.io/open/833775039) ^rw833775039
- Stillness is the key to, well, just about everything. To being a better parent, a better artist, a better investor, a better athlete, a better scientist, a better human being. To unlocking all that we are capable of in this life. [Location 198](https://readwise.io/open/833775040) ^rw833775040
- To achieve stillness, we’ll need to focus on three domains, the timeless trinity of mind, body, soul—the head, the heart, the flesh. [Location 230](https://readwise.io/open/833775041) ^rw833775041

- This is, in fact, the first obligation of a leader and a decision maker. Our job is not to “go with our gut” or fixate on the first impression we form about an issue. No, we need to be strong enough to resist thinking that is too neat, too plausible, and therefore almost always wrong. Because if the leader can’t take the time to develop a clear sense of the bigger picture, who will? If the leader isn’t thinking through all the way to the end, who is? [Location 275](https://readwise.io/open/833775042) ^rw833775042
- Keep strong, if possible. In any case, keep cool. Have unlimited patience. Never corner an opponent, and always assist him to save face. Put yourself in his shoes—so as to see things through his eyes. Avoid self-righteousness like the devil—nothing is so self-blinding. [Location 287](https://readwise.io/open/833775043) ^rw833775043
- As we stand on the podium, about to give a speech, our mind is focused not on our task but on what everyone will think of us. How does that not affect our performance? As we struggle with a crisis, our mind repeats on a loop just how unfair this is, how insane it is that it keeps happening and how it can’t go on. Why are we draining ourselves of essential emotional and mental energies right when we need them most? [Location 417](https://readwise.io/open/870393997) ^rw870393997
- The less energy we waste regretting the past or worrying about the future, the more energy we will have for what’s in front of us. [Location 446](https://readwise.io/open/833775044) ^rw833775044
- This moment we are experiencing right now is a gift (that’s why we call it the present). Even if it is a stressful, trying experience—it could be our last. So let’s develop the ability to be in it, to put everything we have into appreciating the plentitude of the now. [Location 450](https://readwise.io/open/833775045) ^rw833775045

- A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention. —HERBERT SIMON [Location 464](https://readwise.io/open/833775046) ^rw833775046
- “If you wish to improve,” Epictetus once said, “be content to appear clueless or stupid in extraneous matters.” [Location 483](https://readwise.io/open/833775047) ^rw833775047
- The important stuff will still be important by the time you get to it. The unimportant will have made its insignificance obvious (or simply disappeared). Then, with stillness rather than needless urgency or exhaustion, you will be able to sit down and give what deserves consideration your full attention. [Location 488](https://readwise.io/open/833775048) ^rw833775048
- In his Meditations, Marcus Aurelius says, “Ask yourself at every moment, ‘Is this necessary?’” [Location 516](https://readwise.io/open/870393998) ^rw870393998
- What’s essential is invisible to the eye. [Location 645](https://readwise.io/open/870393999) ^rw870393999
- It’s a message he shared with adults too. “Just think,” Rogers once wrote to a struggling friend. “Just be quiet and think. It’ll make all the difference in the world.” [Location 660](https://readwise.io/open/870394000) ^rw870394000
- Journaling is a way to ask tough questions: Where am I standing in my own way? What’s the smallest step I can take toward a big thing today? Why am I so worked up about this? What blessings can I count right now? Why do I care so much about impressing people? What is the harder choice I’m avoiding? Do I rule my fears, or do they rule me? How will today’s difficulties reveal my character?* [Location 747](https://readwise.io/open/870394001) ^rw870394001
