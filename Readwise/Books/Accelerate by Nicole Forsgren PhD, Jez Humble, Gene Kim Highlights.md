## Highlights
- The key to successful change is measuring and understanding the right things with a focus on capabilities—not on maturity. While maturity models are very popular in the industry, we cannot stress enough that maturity models are not the appropriate tool to use or mindset to have.

- A successful measure of performance should have two key characteristics. First, it should focus on a global outcome to ensure teams aren’t pitted against each other. [Location 487](https://readwise.io/open/158156182) ^rw158156182
- Second, our measure should focus on outcomes not output: it shouldn’t reward people for putting in large amounts of busywork that doesn’t actually help achieve organizational goals. [Location 490](https://readwise.io/open/158156183) ^rw158156183
- In our search for measures of delivery performance that meet these criteria, we settled on four: delivery lead time, deployment frequency, time to restore service, and change fail rate. [Location 492](https://readwise.io/open/158156184) ^rw158156184
- Lead time is the time it takes to go from a customer making a request to the request being satisfied. [Location 494](https://readwise.io/open/158156185) ^rw158156185
