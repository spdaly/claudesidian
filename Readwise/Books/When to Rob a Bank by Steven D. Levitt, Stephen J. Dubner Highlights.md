## Highlights
- What does tenure do? It distorts people’s effort so that they face strong incentives early in their career (and presumably work very hard early on as a consequence) and very weak incentives forever after (and presumably work much less hard on average as a consequence).

- Tenure does an outstanding job of protecting scholars who do no work or terrible work, but is there anything in economics which is high quality but so controversial that it would lead to a scholar being fired? [Location 413](https://readwise.io/open/158156393) ^rw158156393

- But it doesn’t take a whole lot of smarts or a whole lot of blind faith in markets to recognize that when you don’t charge people for things (including health care), they will consume too much of it. [Location 525](https://readwise.io/open/158156394) ^rw158156394

- “I don’t expect perfection, I expect excellence.” I expect 100 percent effort in all you do. [Location 1280](https://readwise.io/open/158156395) ^rw158156395
- being happy (on average) in the moment and being satisfied retrospectively are not the same thing. People are most likely to be happy if they spend a lot of time with people they love, and most likely to be satisfied if they achieve conventional goals, such as high income and a stable marriage.

- As we’ve written before, most people are terrible at risk assessment. They tend to overstate the risk of dramatic and unlikely events at the expense of more common and boring (if equally devastating) events. [Location 1840](https://readwise.io/open/158156397) ^rw158156397
