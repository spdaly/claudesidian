## Highlights
- While trying harder helps just about everything, telling someone with ADD to try harder is no more helpful than telling someone who is nearsighted to squint harder. It missed the biological point. [Location 127](https://readwise.io/open/158156029) ^rw158156029
- ADD is a neurological syndrome whose classic defining triad of symptoms include impulsivity, distractibility, and hyperactivity or excess energy. [Location 251](https://readwise.io/open/158156030) ^rw158156030
- In fact, many people who have ADD are very smart. It’s just that their smartness gets tangled up inside. [Location 256](https://readwise.io/open/158156031) ^rw158156031
- “How do I screw up?” he asked, then repeated the question again, turning it into a sorrowful statement by his tone of voice. “How do I screw up. I forget. I argue. I postpone. I procrastinate. I get lost. I get mad. I don’t follow through. You name it, I do it. I’ll get into these discussions with my boss, and I’ll see my way is right, [Location 290](https://readwise.io/open/158156032) ^rw158156032
- The hallmark symptoms of ADD are easy distractibility, impulsivity, and sometimes, but not always, hyperactivity or excess energy. These people are on the go. Type A personalities. Thrill seekers. High-energy–, action-oriented–, bottom-line–, gotta-run–type people. They have lots of projects going simultaneously. [Location 347](https://readwise.io/open/158156033) ^rw158156033
- They have lots of projects going simultaneously. They’re always scrambling. They procrastinate a lot and they have trouble finishing things. Their moods can be quite unstable, going from high to low in the bat of an eye for no apparent reason. They can be irritable, even rageful, especially when interrupted or when making transitions. Their memories are porous. They daydream a lot. They love high-stimulus situations. They love action and novelty. Just as this kind of problem can get in the way at work, it can also interfere with close relationships. [Location 349](https://readwise.io/open/158156034) ^rw158156034

- “Yes,” I said. “It’s part of the impulsivity. If you think of ADD as a basic problem with inhibition, it helps explain how ADD people get angry quicker. They don’t inhibit their impulses as well as other people. They lack the little pause between impulse and action that allows most people to be able to stop and think.

- Due to repeated failures, misunderstandings, mislabelings, and all manner of other emotional mishaps, children with ADD usually develop problems with their self-image and self-esteem. [Location 459](https://readwise.io/open/158156036) ^rw158156036
- An important, and often overlooked part of both learning disabilities and ADD is the social consequence of having them. ADD can interfere with one’s interpersonal life just as dramatically as it does with one’s academic or job performance. To make friends, you have to be able to pay attention. To get along in a group, you have to be able to follow what is being said in the group. Social cues are often subtle: the narrowing of eyes, the raising of eyebrows, a slight change in tone of voice, a tilting of the head. [Location 507](https://readwise.io/open/158156037) ^rw158156037
- “Sidetracked?” she said with a big smile. “My whole life is one long sidetrack. [Location 664](https://readwise.io/open/158156038) ^rw158156038
- One minute I’m there and then the next I’m not. I don’t finish things. I get started, and then I drift off to something else, and then I’ve forgotten about what I had started on in the first place.” [Location 687](https://readwise.io/open/158156039) ^rw158156039
- I wasn’t surprised that she had taken up exercise. Aside from being one of our culture’s preoccupations, it is remarkably good therapy for ADD, both focusing and relaxing the mind. [Location 690](https://readwise.io/open/158156040) ^rw158156040
- However, as we have mentioned, there is more to the treatment for ADD than just medication. Education, behavioral modification, and psychotherapy all can help. [Location 719](https://readwise.io/open/158156041) ^rw158156041

- “full of chaos and impulse surrounded by a fog of depression, heated by desperation.” [Location 1122](https://readwise.io/open/158156042) ^rw158156042
- Primary symptoms are the symptoms of the syndrome itself: distractibility, impulsivity, restlessness, and so forth. The secondary symptoms, and the ones that are most difficult to treat, are the symptoms that develop in the wake of the primary syndrome not being recognized: low self-esteem, depression, boredom and frustration with school, fear of learning new [Location 1146](https://readwise.io/open/158156043) ^rw158156043
- things, impaired peer relations, sometimes drug or alcohol abuse, stealing, or even violent behavior due to mounting frustration. [Location 1148](https://readwise.io/open/158156044) ^rw158156044
- People with ADD often do not pick up on the subtle social cues and messages that are crucial in getting along with others. They may appear to be blasé or indifferent or self-centered or even hostile when they are [Location 1161](https://readwise.io/open/158156045) ^rw158156045
- The themes of ADD run throughout: inconsistency, and inconsistency again, creativity, provocative behavior, winning personality, varying motivation, exasperating forgetfulness, disorganization and indifference, underachievement, impulsivity, and the search for excitement rather than discipline. [Location 1397](https://readwise.io/open/158156046) ^rw158156046
- Most adults with ADD are struggling to express a part of themselves that often seems unraveled as they strive to join the thought behind unto the thought before. [Location 1490](https://readwise.io/open/158156047) ^rw158156047
- These are a few of the areas in which mild ADD may interfere with an adult’s life: underachievement; reading one’s interpersonal world accurately; getting started on a creative project, or finishing it; staying with emotions long enough to work them out; getting organized; getting rid of perseverative, negative thinking; slowing down; finding the time to do what one has always wanted to do; or getting a handle on certain compulsive types of behavior. [Location 1678](https://readwise.io/open/158156048) ^rw158156048
- The emotional experience of ADD is filled with embarrassment, humiliation, and self-castigation. By the time the diagnosis is made, many people with ADD have lost confidence in themselves. Many have been misunderstood repeatedly. Many have consulted with numerous specialists, only to find no real help. As a result, many have lost hope.

- But pharmaceutical companies have stepped up with better generic varieties as well as true long-acting brands. There is Ritalin LA (a better version of Ritalin SR), Methylin, Metadate, and a generic methylphenidate that works much better than the older versions. We also have Focalin and Focalin XR, which is the d-isomer of methylphenidate and is a bit stronger and a bit longer lasting than [Location 4505](https://readwise.io/open/158156050) ^rw158156050
