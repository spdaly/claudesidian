## Highlights
- turbulent times were precisely the right time to explore the hard work of making big change. [Location 71](https://readwise.io/open/158156668) ^rw158156668
- “A crisis,” Romer famously said, “is a terrible thing to waste.” [Location 95](https://readwise.io/open/158156669) ^rw158156669
- very different sorts of risks. One is that their organization will make a bold move that fails—a risk they call “sinking the boat.” The other is that their organization will fail to make a bold move that would have succeeded—a risk they call “missing the boat.” Naturally, most executives worry more about sinking the boat than missing the boat, which is why so many organizations, even in flush times, are so cautious and conservative. [Location 211](https://readwise.io/open/158156670) ^rw158156670
- recognize the power of rocking the boat—searching for big ideas and small wrinkles, inside and outside the organization, that help you make waves [Location 214](https://readwise.io/open/158156671) ^rw158156671
- The challenge for leaders in every field is to emerge from turbulent times with closer connections to their customers, with more energy and creativity from their people, and with greater distance between them and their rivals. [Location 218](https://readwise.io/open/158156672) ^rw158156672
- Leading Change, [Location 422](https://readwise.io/open/158156673) ^rw158156673
- Let’s be clear: We are living in the age of disruption. You can’t do big things anymore if you are content with doing things a little better than everyone else, or a little differently from how you’ve done them in the past. [Location 438](https://readwise.io/open/158156674) ^rw158156674
- Vuja dé is the flip side of that—looking at a familiar situation (an industry you’ve worked in for decades, products you’ve worked on for years) as if you’ve never seen it before, and, with that fresh line of sight, developing a distinctive point of view on the future. [Location 444](https://readwise.io/open/158156675) ^rw158156675
- How do you look at your organization and your field as if you are seeing them for the first time? [Location 447](https://readwise.io/open/158156676) ^rw158156676
- Weird Ideas That Work, [Location 451](https://readwise.io/open/158156677) ^rw158156677
- Disruption: Overturning Conventions and Shaking Up the Marketplace, [Location 477](https://readwise.io/open/158156678) ^rw158156678
- In her underappreciated book, The Innovation Killer, Cynthia Barton Rabe, a former innovation strategist at Intel, explains how “what we know limits what we can imagine.” [Location 1446](https://readwise.io/open/158156679) ^rw158156679
- A Sense of Urgency—that’s the big missing ingredient. “It occurred to me how often I was being asked, ‘What is the single biggest error people make when they try to change?’ ” he wrote. “After reflection, I decided the answer was that they did not create a high enough sense of urgency among enough people to set the stage for making a challenging leap in some new direction.” [Location 1726](https://readwise.io/open/158156680) ^rw158156680
- “If all you ever do is all you’ve ever done, then all you’ll ever get is all you ever got.” [Location 1774](https://readwise.io/open/158156681) ^rw158156681
- Our whole philosophy is to take most of the money we would spend on marketing, put it into the customer experience, and let word of mouth be our true form of marketing. Repeat customers buy more and become our best advocates.” [Location 1864](https://readwise.io/open/158156682) ^rw158156682
- change, the only thing more worrisome than the prospect of too much experimentation and change may be the reality of too little experimentation and change—especially when there are too many competitors chasing too few customers with products and services that look too much alike. [Location 1919](https://readwise.io/open/158156683) ^rw158156683
- The lesson is as simple as it is subversive: it’s not good enough to be “pretty good” at everything anymore. You have to be the most of something: the most elegant, the most colorful, the most responsive, the most focused. [Location 2001](https://readwise.io/open/158156684) ^rw158156684

- “There’s nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos.” [Location 2006](https://readwise.io/open/158156685) ^rw158156685
- the discussion: First, What are we not doing that we should start doing right away? Second, What should we immediately stop doing in order to allow for the emergence of the new?
