## Highlights
- Samuel thought how his father married to his mother was like a spoon married to a garbage disposal. [Location 1470](https://readwise.io/open/158156313) ^rw158156313
- Any problem you face in a video game or in life is one of four things: an enemy, obstacle, puzzle, or trap. That’s it. Everyone you meet in life is one of those four things.” [Location 3600](https://readwise.io/open/158156314) ^rw158156314

- “You have to be careful,” Pwnage said, “with people who are puzzles and people who are traps. A puzzle can be solved but a trap cannot. Usually what happens is you think someone’s a puzzle until you realize they’re a trap. But by then it’s too late. That’s the trap.” [Location 3619](https://readwise.io/open/158156315) ^rw158156315
- It’s no secret that the great American pastime is no longer baseball. Now it’s sanctimony.” [Location 5124](https://readwise.io/open/158156316) ^rw158156316
- These are the questions you ask when you’re cracking up. When you suddenly recognize that not only are you living a life you never intended to lead but also you are feeling assaulted and punished by the life you have. You begin searching for those early wrong turns. What moment led you into the maze? You begin thinking the entrance to the maze might also be the exit, and if you can identify the moment you screwed up then you can perform some huge course correction and save yourself.

- Sometimes we’re so wrapped up in our own story that we don’t see how we’re supporting characters in someone else’s. [Location 10972](https://readwise.io/open/158156318) ^rw158156318
