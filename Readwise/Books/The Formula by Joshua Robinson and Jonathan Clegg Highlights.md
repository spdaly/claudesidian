## Highlights
- Mercedes would trace its costly mistake back to one single data point in the initial design simulations. Of course, it was too late to do anything about it quickly. Undoing the misguided approach for the W13, which also influenced the 2023 car, would take nearly two seasons and the best part of $700 million. It’s no exaggeration to call it one of the most expensive mistakes in the history of professional sports. [Location 538](https://readwise.io/open/833775075) ^rw833775075
- is a sport where success is built on perpetual reinvention. The combination of shifting rules, evolving technology, and astronomical rewards means that it’s not enough to do things marginally better than your rivals. The only way to win championships is to land a series of technical moon shots—and then do it all over again. [Location 556](https://readwise.io/open/833775076) ^rw833775076
- “You should never let people know you’re running a brothel,” Ferrari once said to Ecclestone. “You have to pretend it’s a hotel and keep the brothel in the basement.” [Location 1115](https://readwise.io/open/833775077) ^rw833775077
- Monaco is lined with concrete walls—and perched on the edge of a cliff. Threading the needle around the two miles and nineteen corners of its twisting streets is so grueling that Nelson Piquet, a three-time world champion and Senna’s countryman, likened it to riding a bicycle around your living room.
