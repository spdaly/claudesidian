## Highlights
- I define anxiety as experiencing failure in advance…and if you have anxiety about initiating a project, then of course you will associate risk with failure. [Location 189](https://readwise.io/open/158156660) ^rw158156660
- Most people shy away from the challenge. They’ve been too abused, they’re too fearful, they hold back, they’re happy to let someone else take the heat. Initiative is scarce. Hence valuable. [Location 341](https://readwise.io/open/158156661) ^rw158156661
- What are you, chicken? Yes, we’re chicken. We’re afraid. The lizard has us by the claws. [Location 352](https://readwise.io/open/158156662) ^rw158156662
- There is no guarantee, though. There are no maps. They’ve all been taken, and their value is not what it used to be, because your competitors have maps, too. [Location 482](https://readwise.io/open/158156663) ^rw158156663
