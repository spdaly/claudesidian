## Highlights
- Steel ultimately identified four main issues that make procrastination more likely—low confidence in succeeding, task aversiveness, distractibility and impulsiveness, and having goals and rewards be too far off in the future. [Location 168](https://readwise.io/open/158156587) ^rw158156587
- “Procrastination is like a dandelion. You pull it up and think you’ve got it, but then it turns out the roots are so deep, it just grows back.” [Location 211](https://readwise.io/open/158156588) ^rw158156588
- Procrastinators often have a “wishful thinking” approach to time or see it as an opponent to outwit, outmaneuver, or outlive. This attitude toward time fuels more procrastination. [Location 224](https://readwise.io/open/158156589) ^rw158156589
