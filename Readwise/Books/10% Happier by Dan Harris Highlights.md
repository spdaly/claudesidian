## Highlights
- meditation is simply exercise for your brain. It’s a proven technique for preventing the voice in your head from leading you around by the nose. [Location 63](https://readwise.io/open/158156026) ^rw158156026
- All of us struggle to strike a balance between the image we present to the world and the reality of our inner landscape. [Location 84](https://readwise.io/open/158156027) ^rw158156027
- writing rules that every correspondent learned to obey over the course of a particularly rigorous hazing period: don’t start a sentence with “but”; don’t say “like” when you can say “such as”; never, ever use the word “meanwhile.” [Location 190](https://readwise.io/open/158156028) ^rw158156028
