## Highlights
- The gene-editing tool that Doudna and others developed in 2012 is based on a virus-fighting trick used by bacteria, which have been battling viruses for more than a billion years. In their DNA, bacteria develop clustered repeated sequences, known as CRISPRs, that can remember and then destroy viruses that attack them.

- The invention of CRISPR and the plague of COVID will hasten our transition to the third great revolution of modern times. These revolutions arose from the discovery, beginning just over a century ago, of the three fundamental kernels of our existence: the atom, the bit, and the gene. [Location 86](https://readwise.io/open/473862443) ^rw473862443
- When Doudna was a graduate student in the 1990s, other biologists were racing to map the genes that are coded by our DNA. But she became more interested in DNA’s less-celebrated sibling, RNA. It’s the molecule that actually does the work in a cell by copying some of the instructions coded by the DNA and using them to build proteins.

- the key to innovation is connecting a curiosity about basic science to the practical work of devising tools that can be applied to our lives—moving discoveries from lab bench to bedside. [Location 118](https://readwise.io/open/473862445) ^rw473862445
- Darwin and Wallace had a key trait that is a catalyst for creativity: they had wide-ranging interests and were able to make connections between different disciplines. [Location 265](https://readwise.io/open/473862446) ^rw473862446
- The easiest of these viruses to study are the ones that attack bacteria, and they were dubbed (remember the term, for it will reappear when we discuss the discovery of CRISPR) “phages,” which was short for “bacteriophages,” meaning bacteria-eaters. [Location 340](https://readwise.io/open/473862447) ^rw473862447
- Two papers published in Science that year gave strong evidence that it might work. The hope then was that drugs based on RNA interference might someday be a good option for treating severe viral infections, including those from new coronaviruses.

- Enzymes are a type of protein. Their main function is to act as a catalyst that sparks chemical reactions in the cells of living organisms, from bacteria to humans. There are more than five thousand biochemical reactions that are catalyzed by enzymes. These include breaking down starches and proteins in the digestive system, causing muscles to contract, sending signals between cells, regulating metabolism, and (most important for this discussion) cutting and splicing DNA and RNA.

- Science can be the parent of invention. But as Matt Ridley points out in his book How Innovation Works, sometimes it’s a two-way street. “It is just as often the case that invention is the parent of science: techniques and processes are developed that work, but the understanding of them comes later,” he writes. “Steam engines led to the understanding of thermodynamics, not the other way round. Powered flight preceded almost all aerodynamics.”2 [Location 1245](https://readwise.io/open/473862452) ^rw473862452
- There are two components to scientific discovery: doing great research and building a lab that does great research. [Location 1413](https://readwise.io/open/473862453) ^rw473862453
- This transition from player to coach happens in many fields. Writers become editors, engineers become managers. [Location 1420](https://readwise.io/open/473862454) ^rw473862454
- “Methodology is important in both,” she says. “You also must know the basics and master the methods. That requires persistence—repeating experiments and repeating them again, perfecting how [Location 1643](https://readwise.io/open/473862455) ^rw473862455
- The study of CRISPR would become a vivid example of the call-and-response duet between basic science and translational medicine. [Location 1808](https://readwise.io/open/473862456) ^rw473862456
- memory can be an unreliable guide to history. [Location 2553](https://readwise.io/open/473862457) ^rw473862457
- Almost every person in any saga tends to remember their own role as being a little more important than the other players see it. That’s true in our own lives. [Location 2880](https://readwise.io/open/473862458) ^rw473862458
- Challenges and so-called disabilities often build character, teach acceptance, and instill resilience. [Location 4687](https://readwise.io/open/474419457) ^rw474419457

- On most great moral issues, there are two competing perspectives. One emphasizes individual rights, personal liberty, and a deference to personal choice. Stemming from John Locke and other Enlightenment thinkers of the seventeenth century, this tradition recognizes that people will have different beliefs about what is good for their lives, and it argues that the state should give them a lot of liberty to make their own choices, as long as they do not harm others. [Location 4869](https://readwise.io/open/474419458) ^rw474419458
- These contrasting perspectives form the most basic political divide of our times. On the one side are those who wish to maximize individual liberty, minimize regulations and taxes, and keep the state out of our lives as much as possible. On the other side are those who wish to promote the common good, create benefits for all of society, minimize the harm that an untrammeled free market can do to our work and environment, and restrict selfish behaviors that might harm the community and the planet. The modern foundations for each of these perspectives was expressed in two influential books written fifty years ago: John Rawls’s A Theory of Justice, which comes down on the side of favoring the good of the community, and Robert Nozick’s Anarchy, State, and Utopia, which emphasizes the moral foundation for individual liberty.

- Vaccines work by stimulating a person’s immune system. A substance that resembles a dangerous virus (or any other pathogen)I is delivered into a person’s body. That substance could be a deactivated version of the virus or a safe fragment of the virus or genetic instructions to make that fragment. This is intended to kick the person’s immune system into gear. When it works, the body produces antibodies that will, sometimes for many years, fend off any infection if the real virus ever attacks. [Location 5880](https://readwise.io/open/475236671) ^rw475236671
- The plague year of 2020 is likely to be remembered as the time when these traditional vaccines began to be supplanted by genetic vaccines. Instead of injecting a weakened or partial version of the dangerous virus into humans, these new vaccines deliver a gene or piece of genetic coding that will guide human cells to produce, on their own, components of the virus. The goal is for these components to stimulate the patient’s immune system. [Location 5901](https://readwise.io/open/475236672) ^rw475236672
- An RNA vaccine has certain advantages over a DNA vaccine. Most notably, the RNA does not need to get into the nucleus of the cell, where DNA is headquartered. The RNA does its work in the outer region of cells, the cytoplasm, which is where proteins are constructed. So an RNA vaccine simply needs to deliver its payload into this outer region.

- As Steve Jobs emphasized when he built a headquarters for Pixar and planned a new Apple campus, new ideas are born out of serendipitous encounters. In-person interactions are especially important in the initial brainstorming of new ideas and the forging of personal bonds. As Aristotle taught, we are a social animal, an instinct that cannot fully be satisfied online. [Location 6300](https://readwise.io/open/478830957) ^rw478830957
