## Highlights
- “Relationships are never fifty-fifty. Sometimes they are sixty-forty, sometimes eighty-twenty. You’ll be the eighty sometimes, you’ll be the twenty others. The key is to accept and be okay with that.” [Location 1088](https://readwise.io/open/223989498) ^rw223989498
- Memories are something we reconstruct and piece together. They are fragments we manufacture to create what we think occurred or even simply hope to be true. In short, our memories are rarely accurate. They are biased reenactments. [Location 1213](https://readwise.io/open/223989499) ^rw223989499
- Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, through his legendary character Sherlock Holmes, said, “Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.” [Location 2526](https://readwise.io/open/223989500) ^rw223989500
- The secret to fulfillment is not about exciting adventures or living out loud—no one can maintain that kind of pace—but in welcoming and even relishing the quiet and familiar. [Location 3884](https://readwise.io/open/226528074) ^rw226528074
