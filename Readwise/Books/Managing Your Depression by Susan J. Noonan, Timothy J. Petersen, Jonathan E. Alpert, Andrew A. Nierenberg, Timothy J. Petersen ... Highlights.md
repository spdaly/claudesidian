- The basic steps include maintaining a regular pattern of sleep, diet, exercise, medications, and social contacts; keeping a routine and structure to your day; and avoiding isolation. [Location 158](https://readwise.io/open/158156113) ^rw158156113
- The key is not to wait until you feel like doing something. Just do it as best as you can now and the motivation for doing it will follow. Many people with depression have found that to be so. It is crucial that you keep trying despite the difficulty and that you give yourself credit for the effort. [Location 199](https://readwise.io/open/158156114) ^rw158156114
