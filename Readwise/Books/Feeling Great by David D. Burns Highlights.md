## Highlights
- I asked Frank if I could try something that might be helpful called the double standard technique. The basis for this technique is that most of us operate on a double standard. When we’re upset or fall short of our goals, we tend to beat up on ourselves with harsh criticisms. But if we were talking to a dear friend with the same exact problem, we’d do so in a far more compassionate, supportive, and realistic way. Once you’re aware of this, you can ask yourself if you’d be willing to talk to yourself in the same compassionate way you’d talk to a dear friend. No single method works for everyone, but this one is often effective. [Location 142](https://readwise.io/open/158156003) ^rw158156003
- 1. You FEEL the way you THINK. In other words, your negative emotions, like depression and anxiety, result from your thoughts and not from the circumstances of your life. 2. The negative thoughts that upset you are nearly always distorted and twisted. They’re just not true. Depression and anxiety are the world’s oldest cons. 3. When you can change the way you THINK, you can change the way you FEEL. [Location 182](https://readwise.io/open/158156004) ^rw158156004
- In contrast to Feeling Good, which was all about the cognitive revolution, this book is all about the motivation revolution. It is based on the simple idea that we sometimes get “stuck” in depression and anxiety because we have mixed feelings about recovery. Although we may be suffering and desperately want to change, there may be powerful conflicting forces that keep us stuck. As strange as this might sound, part of you may fight against—or resist—the very change you’re yearning for. [Location 212](https://readwise.io/open/158156005) ^rw158156005
- Your feelings result entirely from how you’re thinking right now. It is your thoughts, and not the circumstances of your life, that create all of your feelings. You FEEL the way you THINK. [Location 475](https://readwise.io/open/254343192) ^rw254343192
- That is what cognitive distortions are: a highly misleading way of thinking about yourself and the world. [Location 479](https://readwise.io/open/254343193) ^rw254343193
- ten of the most common cognitive distortions: [Location 481](https://readwise.io/open/254343194) ^rw254343194
- Feelings of inferiority nearly always result from mental filtering and discounting the positive. [Location 507](https://readwise.io/open/254343195) ^rw254343195
- For decades, mental health professionals have urged patients to get in touch with their feelings. But your feelings are not always a reliable guide to reality and can sometimes be incredibly misleading, especially when you feel depressed, anxious, or angry. That’s because feelings result from thoughts, and as you’re learning, negative thoughts are often distorted. [Location 540](https://readwise.io/open/254343196) ^rw254343196
