- But we all discussed Blockchain confidently. The reason is simple: TV program producers do not need to know how TV signals are launched and displayed, and it is not necessary for mobile phone designers to understand technical principles of 4G (the 4-generation mobile communication technology) and functions of each component.

- Blockchain is actually a kind of concept that replaces authority control and affect-based trust with technical design to establish a network structure in which all participants can become nodes and be involved in authentication, right confirmation, transaction, review, and adjustment.
