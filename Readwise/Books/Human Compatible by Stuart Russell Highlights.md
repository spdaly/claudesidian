## Highlights
- The roots of AI stretch far back into antiquity, but its “official” beginning was in 1956. Two young mathematicians, John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky, had persuaded Claude Shannon, already famous as the inventor of information theory, and Nathaniel Rochester, the designer of IBM’s first commercial computer, to join them in organizing a summer program at Dartmouth College. The goal was stated as follows: The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves. We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.

- The first AI bubble burst in the late 1960s, when early efforts at machine learning and machine translation failed to live up to expectations. A report commissioned by the UK government in 1973 concluded, “In no part of the field have the discoveries made so far produced the major impact that was then promised.”4 In other words, the machines just weren’t smart enough. My eleven-year-old self was, fortunately, unaware of this [Location 237](https://readwise.io/open/570474862) ^rw570474862
- was experiencing a huge revival thanks to the commercial potential of so-called expert systems. The second AI bubble burst when these systems proved to be inadequate for many of the tasks to which they were applied. Again, the machines just weren’t smart enough. An AI winter ensued.

- Beginning around 2011, deep learning techniques began to produce dramatic advances in speech recognition, visual object recognition, and machine translation—three of the most important open problems in the field. By some measures, machines now match or exceed human capabilities in these areas. In 2016 and 2017, DeepMind’s AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol, former world Go champion, and Ke Jie, the current champion—events that some experts predicted wouldn’t happen until 2097, if ever.

- statistics, learning algorithms are designed to minimize an expected loss function that defines the cost of making prediction errors. [Location 319](https://readwise.io/open/570474865) ^rw570474865
- “The purpose put into the machine” is exactly the objective that machines are optimizing in the standard model. If we put the wrong objective into a machine that is more intelligent than us, it will achieve the objective, and we lose. [Location 329](https://readwise.io/open/570474866) ^rw570474866
- The problem is not that we might fail to do a good job of building AI systems; it’s that we might succeed too well. The very definition of success in AI is wrong. [Location 357](https://readwise.io/open/570474867) ^rw570474867
- Roughly speaking, an entity is intelligent to the extent that what it does is likely to achieve what it wants, given what it has perceived. [Location 369](https://readwise.io/open/570474868) ^rw570474868
- code. All those Hollywood plots about machines mysteriously becoming conscious and hating humans are really missing the point: it’s competence, not consciousness, that matters. [Location 417](https://readwise.io/open/570474869) ^rw570474869
- One reason we understand the brain’s reward system is that it resembles the method of reinforcement learning developed in AI, for which we have a very solid theory.4 [Location 424](https://readwise.io/open/570474870) ^rw570474870
