## Highlights
- Principles are fundamental truths that serve as the foundations for behavior that gets you what you want out of life. They can be applied again and again in similar situations to help you achieve your goals. [Location 68](https://readwise.io/open/158156229) ^rw158156229
- Having a good set of principles is like having a good collection of recipes for success. All [Location 72](https://readwise.io/open/158156230) ^rw158156230
- We believe that thoughtful, unemotional disagreement by independent thinkers can be converted into believability-weighted decision making that is smarter and more effective than the sum of its parts. [Location 177](https://readwise.io/open/158156231) ^rw158156231
- from Thoreau: “If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.” [Location 262](https://readwise.io/open/158156232) ^rw158156232
- Meditation has benefited me hugely throughout my life because it produces a calm open-mindedness that allows me to think more clearly and creatively. [Location 281](https://readwise.io/open/158156233) ^rw158156233
- “You better make sense of what happened to other people in other times and other places because if you don’t you won’t know if these things can happen to you and, if they do, you won’t know how to deal with them.” [Location 332](https://readwise.io/open/158156234) ^rw158156234
- While making money was good, having meaningful work and meaningful relationships was far better. To me, meaningful work is being on a mission I become engrossed in, and meaningful relationships are those I have with people I care deeply about and who care deeply about me. [Location 448](https://readwise.io/open/158156235) ^rw158156235
- The most volatile cost that the chicken producer needed to worry about was feed prices. I showed Lane how to use a mix of corn and soymeal futures to lock in costs so they could quote a fixed price to McDonald’s. Having greatly reduced its price risk, McDonald’s introduced the McNugget in 1983. I felt great about helping make that happen. [Location 474](https://readwise.io/open/158156236) ^rw158156236
- Imagine that in order to have a great life you have to cross a dangerous jungle. You can stay safe where you are and have an ordinary life, or you can risk crossing the jungle to have a terrific life. How would you approach that choice? Take a moment to think about it because it is the sort of choice that, in one form or another, we all have to make. [Location 614](https://readwise.io/open/158156237) ^rw158156237
- 1. Seek out the smartest people who disagreed with me so I could try to understand their reasoning. 2. Know when not to have an opinion. 3. Develop, test, and systemize timeless and universal principles. 4. Balance risks in ways that keep the big upside while reducing the downside. [Location 624](https://readwise.io/open/158156238) ^rw158156238
- this experience led me to build Bridgewater as an idea meritocracy—not an autocracy in which I lead and others follow, and not a democracy in which everyone’s vote is equal—but a meritocracy that encourages thoughtful disagreements and explores and weighs people’s opinions in proportion to their merits.

- Looking back on getting fired from Apple in 1985, Steve Jobs said, “It was awful-tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith. I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did.” [Location 639](https://readwise.io/open/158156240) ^rw158156240

- “He who lives by the crystal ball is destined to eat ground glass” is a saying I quoted a lot in those days. Between 1979 and 1982, I had eaten enough glass to realize that what was most important wasn’t knowing the future—it was knowing how to react appropriately to the information available at each point in time. In order to do that, I would have to have a vast store [Location 669](https://readwise.io/open/158156241) ^rw158156241
- Truth be known, forecasts aren’t worth very much, and most people who make them don’t make money in the markets. [Location 703](https://readwise.io/open/158156242) ^rw158156242

- Maturity is the ability to reject good alternatives in order to pursue even better ones. [Location 797](https://readwise.io/open/158156243) ^rw158156243

- I believe that all organizations basically have two types of people: those who work to be part of a mission, and those who work for a paycheck. I [Location 861](https://readwise.io/open/158156244) ^rw158156244
- I didn’t value experience as much as character, creativity, and common sense, which I suppose was related to my having started Bridgewater two years out of school myself, and my belief that having an ability to figure things out is more important than having specific knowledge of how to do something. [Location 899](https://readwise.io/open/158156245) ^rw158156245
- well in practice as it did on paper. I called it the “Holy Grail of Investing” because it showed the path to making a fortune. This was another key moment [Location 933](https://readwise.io/open/158156246) ^rw158156246
- For that reason I insisted that an issue log be adopted throughout Bridgewater. My rule was simple: If something went badly, you had to put it in the log, characterize its severity, and make clear who was responsible for it. If a mistake happened and you logged it, you were okay. If you didn’t log it, you would be in deep trouble. This way managers had problems brought to them, which was worlds better than having to seek them out. The error log (which we now call the issue log) was our first management tool. I learned subsequently how important tools are in helping to reinforce desired behaviors, which led us to create a number of tools I will describe later. This culture of bringing problems [Location 1001](https://readwise.io/open/158156247) ^rw158156247
- 1. Put our honest thoughts out on the table, 2. Have thoughtful disagreements in which people are willing to shift their opinions as they learn, and 3. Have agreed-upon ways of deciding (e.g., voting, having clear authorities) if disagreements remain so that we can move beyond them without resentments. [Location 1042](https://readwise.io/open/158156248) ^rw158156248
- Problems would be hidden instead of brought to the surface where they could be resolved. To have a real idea meritocracy, there must be transparency so that people can see things for themselves. [Location 1165](https://readwise.io/open/158156249) ^rw158156249
- Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) assessment for the first time and found its description of my preferences to be remarkably accurate. [Location 1181](https://readwise.io/open/158156250) ^rw158156250
- Getting a lot of attention for being successful is a bad position to be in. Australians call it the “tall poppy syndrome,” because the tallest poppies in a field are the ones most likely to have their heads whacked off. I didn’t like the attention and I especially didn’t like the mischaracterizations of Bridgewater as a cult, because I felt it was hurting [Location 1362](https://readwise.io/open/158156251) ^rw158156251
- Of course, most of the people who come to Bridgewater are adventurous types; they know what they’re getting into. They understand that the chances their job will not work out are higher than normal, but they embrace the risk because the upside of succeeding is huge relative to the downside of having it not work out. In the worst case they learn a lot about themselves, have an interesting experience, and leave for other jobs; [Location 1392](https://readwise.io/open/158156252) ^rw158156252
- A shaper is someone who comes up with unique and valuable visions and builds them out beautifully, typically over the doubts and opposition of others. [Location 1446](https://readwise.io/open/158156253) ^rw158156253
- All these tools reinforce good habits and good thinking. The good habits come from thinking repeatedly in a principled way, like learning to speak a language. The good thinking comes from exploring the reasoning behind the principles. [Location 1570](https://readwise.io/open/158156254) ^rw158156254
