## Highlights
- Ease, comfort, pleasure—they are all fine as far as they go, but they are certainly not life’s point; creative exertion, even struggle, makes life matter. [Location 105](https://readwise.io/open/389966733) ^rw389966733
- “Nietzsche regards the failure to draw a distinction between happiness and contentment as especially disastrous,” writes Nietzsche scholar Michael Tanner. “For him, the only happiness worth having is that which is the by-product of strenuous efforts in various directions, efforts undertaken without a thought for the happiness they might produce.” [Location 234](https://readwise.io/open/389966734) ^rw389966734
- Nietzsche concludes that “instruction without invigoration” and “knowledge not attended by action” is a luxurious waste. It must be “hated by us.” The point of life—even a scholarly life—is not to get through content; it is not to master material. It is to learn how to live. And then to actually live. [Location 307](https://readwise.io/open/389966735) ^rw389966735
- Annie Dillard once wrote, the way we spend our days is the way we spend our lives, then many of us are spending our lives consuming content of fairly dubious long-term value. [Location 317](https://readwise.io/open/389966736) ^rw389966736
- That’s the heart of the approach that Nietzsche develops toward knowledge: Know yourself. Know your limits and embrace them. Reject the burden of any information that does not contribute to living your life. That means setting aside huge swaths of content. Nietzsche’s theory of information management emphasizes slow reading, rereading, not reading—even forgetting. To truly live, we must be willing not to know many things.
