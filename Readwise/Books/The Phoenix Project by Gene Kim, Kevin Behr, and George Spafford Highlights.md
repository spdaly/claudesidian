## Highlights
- hour later, we finally write on the whiteboard: “a ‘change’ is any activity that is physical, logical, or virtual to applications, databases, operating systems, networks, or hardware that could impact services being delivered.” [Location 1124](https://readwise.io/open/158156466) ^rw158156466
- “What?” I ask. “You’re right that you can’t achieve the strategic until you’ve mastered the tactical,” [Location 1214](https://readwise.io/open/158156467) ^rw158156467
- “Once you figure this out, young Bill, you will be well on your way toward understanding the Three Ways,” he says. “The First Way helps us understand how to create fast flow of work as it moves from Development into IT Operations, because that’s what’s between the business and the customer. The Second Way shows us how to shorten and amplify feedback loops, so we can fix quality at the source and avoid rework. And the Third Way shows us [Location 1291](https://readwise.io/open/158156468) ^rw158156468
- I smirk at the reference to smoke tests, a term circuit designers use. The saying goes, “If you turn the circuit board on and no smoke comes out, it’ll probably work.” [Location 1834](https://readwise.io/open/158156469) ^rw158156469
- categories of work are?” I hear him ask. “Yes, I think I can,” I say. “At the plant, I gave you one category, which was business projects, like Phoenix,” I say. “Later, I realized that I didn’t mention internal IT projects. A week after that, I realized that changes are another category of work. But it was only after the Phoenix fiasco that I saw the last one, because of how it prevented all other work from getting completed, and that’s the last category, isn’t it? Firefighting. Unplanned work.” “Precisely!” I hear Erik say. “You even used the term I like most for it: unplanned work. Firefighting is vividly descriptive, but ‘unplanned work’ is even better. It might even be better to call it ‘anti-work,’ since it further highlights its destructive and avoidable nature. “Unlike the other categories of work, unplanned work is recovery work, which almost always takes you away from your [Location 2358](https://readwise.io/open/158156470) ^rw158156470
- Step 3, which is to subordinate the constraint. In the Theory of Constraints, this is typically implemented by something called Drum-Buffer-Rope. [Location 2401](https://readwise.io/open/158156471) ^rw158156471
- Chester, your peer in Development, is spending all his cycles on features, instead of stability, security, scalability, manageability, operability, continuity, and all those other beautiful ’itties. [Location 2414](https://readwise.io/open/158156472) ^rw158156472

- “Remember, outcomes are what matter—not the process, not controls, or, for that matter, what work you complete.” [Location 2426](https://readwise.io/open/158156473) ^rw158156473

- You’ve just described ‘technical debt’ that is not being paid down. It comes from taking shortcuts, which may make sense in the short-term. But like financial debt, the compounding interest costs grow over time. If an organization doesn’t pay down its technical debt, every calorie in the organization can be spent just paying interest, in the form of unplanned work.” [Location 2828](https://readwise.io/open/158156474) ^rw158156474
- Left unchecked, technical debt will ensure that the only work that gets done is unplanned work!” [Location 2834](https://readwise.io/open/158156475) ^rw158156475

- burning platform right now to finally do the right thing. We need to strike while the iron is hot. This is a perfect storm for us to finally get the budget we need to not only do the right things, but do the right things right.” [Location 2880](https://readwise.io/open/158156476) ^rw158156476
- “every work center is made up of four things: the machine, the man, the method, and the measures. [Location 3055](https://readwise.io/open/158156477) ^rw158156477
- ‘Improving daily work is even more important than doing daily work.’ [Location 3110](https://readwise.io/open/158156478) ^rw158156478
- less painful. “Mike Rother says that it almost doesn’t matter what you improve, as long as you’re improving something. Why? Because if you are not improving, entropy guarantees that you are actually getting worse, which ensures that there is no path to zero errors, zero work-related accidents, and zero loss.” [Location 3112](https://readwise.io/open/158156479) ^rw158156479
- “My plant supervisor friend also told me about the Improvement Kata they’ve adopted. Believe it or not, Erik helped them institute it many years ago. They have continual two-week improvement cycles, each requiring them to implement one small Plan-Do-Check-Act project to keep them marching toward the goal. You don’t mind that I’ve taken the liberty of adopting this practice in our group to keep us moving toward our own goals, right?” [Location 3348](https://readwise.io/open/158156480) ^rw158156480
- “To tell the truth is an act of love. To withhold the truth is an act of hate. Or worse, apathy.” [Location 3556](https://readwise.io/open/158156481) ^rw158156481
- Allspaw and Hammond espoused are the inevitable outcome of applying the Three Ways to the IT value stream. It totally changed how we managed IT and it saved our company. “How did they do it?” I ask, dumbfounded. [Location 4361](https://readwise.io/open/158156482) ^rw158156482
- then codified the practices and principles that enable multiple deployments per day in their seminal book Continuous Delivery. Eric Ries then showed us how this capability can help the business learn and win in his Lean Startup work.” [Location 4370](https://readwise.io/open/158156483) ^rw158156483
- “In ten years, I’m certain every COO worth their salt will have come from IT. Any COO who doesn’t intimately understand the IT systems that actually run the business is just an empty suit, relying on someone else to do their job.” [Location 4926](https://readwise.io/open/158156484) ^rw158156484
- As if Steve knows what I’m thinking, he says, “You know, when Erik and I first met, many months ago, he said that the relationship between IT and the business is like a dysfunctional marriage—both feel powerless and held hostage by the other. I’ve thought about this for months, and I finally figured something out. [Location 4935](https://readwise.io/open/158156485) ^rw158156485
- “A dysfunctional marriage assumes that the business and IT are two separate entities. IT should either be embedded into business operations or into the business. Voilà! There you go. No tension. [Location 4937](https://readwise.io/open/158156486) ^rw158156486
