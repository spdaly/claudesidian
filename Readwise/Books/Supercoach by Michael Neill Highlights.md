## Highlights
- One of the best descriptions of the shift that happens when you begin to live your life from a deeper understanding of these secrets is the creation of what my clients and I call "effortless success." This isn't about an avoidance of physical effort; it's about an absence of mental struggle. Happiness leads to success, well-being leads to inspiration, and that success and inspiration become the basis for creating an ever more wonderful life.

- One day a client explained this feeling to me by saying, "It's like I'm driving my daddy's Ferrari-it's incredibly fun, and I'm really moving forward, but every time I start to feel that I'm going too fast, I slam on the brakes because I'm terrified of crashing the car!"

- The world is what you think it is.While at first glance this may seem like an innocuous idea, its implications are far-reaching. If the world is what you think it is, then life becomes one giant self-fulfilling prophecy. Your expectations create yourexperience, and if anything happens that confounds your expectations, you will most likely find a way of explaining it away or fitting it into your existing worldview.
