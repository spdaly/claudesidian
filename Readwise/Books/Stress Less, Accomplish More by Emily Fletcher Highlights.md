## Highlights
- The mind thinks involuntarily, just like the heart beats involuntarily. One more time, for dramatic effect: *The mind thinks involuntarily, just like the heart beats involuntarily.* Just for kicks, take two seconds and try to give your heart a command to stop beating [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/533670213) ^rw533670213
- 3 M’s: Mindfulness, Meditation, and Manifesting [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/533670451) ^rw533670451
- Mindfulness is a “directed focus” mental practice, meaning that you have some point of concentration during the exercise [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/533670947) ^rw533670947
- Mindfulness: The art of bringing your awareness into the present moment [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/533671162) ^rw533671162
- I think of mindfulness as the appetizer to the main course of the Ziva Technique—meditation. Mindfulness is a great tool to use if you’re stressed in the right now and want to feel better immediately. Similarly [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/533674168) ^rw533674168
- I use mindfulness as a runway *into* meditation [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/533673026) ^rw533673026
- Meditation gives the body deep, healing rest—rest that is actually deeper than sleep. When you give your body the rest it needs, it knows how to heal itself. One of the things it heals itself from is stress. The less stress you have in your body, the easier it is for you to perform at the top of your game. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/533674887) ^rw533674887
- *Nishkam karma* meditation requires no effort, no focused concentration, and, thankfully, no struggling to “clear the mind.” I like to think of it as the “lazy man’s meditation.” Instead of trying to force yourself into a cosmic abyss of black-hole nothingness, you allow the body to innocently and spontaneously access a deeply restful state. There is a tool that helps with this; it’s called a mantra [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/533685416) ^rw533685416
- In actuality, the word *mantra*—Sanskrit for “mind vehicle”—is a word or sound used as an anchor to de-excite the nervous system, access more subtle states of consciousness, and induce deep, healing rest. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/533687881) ^rw533687881
- Mantra: Sanskrit, from *man* = “mind” and *tra* = “vehicle.” A mantra is used as an anchor to de-excite the nervous system, access more subtle states of consciousness, and induce deep, healing rest. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/533688754) ^rw533688754
- Manifesting is simply getting clear about precisely what you want to create in your life, or consciously curating a life you love [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/533708355) ^rw533708355
- Manifestation tools help you get crystal clear on your desires so you start to act as if they are on the way. Think of it as placing your order with the great cosmic waitress at the great cosmic restaurant. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/533708397) ^rw533708397
