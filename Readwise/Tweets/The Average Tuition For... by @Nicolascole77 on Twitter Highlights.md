## Highlights
- The average tuition for an MBA comes to $60,000 per year.
  That means you're $120,000 in debt...
  ...before you begin your business journey!
  Or, you could spend less than $250 and read these 8 legendary books on marketing, positioning, and copywriting: [View Tweet](https://readwise.io/open/310340914) ^rw310340914
- 1/ Play Bigger by @lochhead @kmaney @alramadan 
  Category Kings win 76% of the category economics.
  Everyone else fights over the remaining 24%.

- 2/ Superconsumers by @EddieWouldGrow 
  The best way to grow your business isn't "more customers."
  It's more Superconsumers.
  Supers spend 30-70%+ more than the average consumer, and buy more products/services more often.
  Win them, and you win the game.

- 3/ Positioning by Al Ries & Jack Trout
  One of the most timeless marketing books ever written, Positioning is the art of creating new space in the customer's mind for your product/service/offering.
  No differentiated position, no meaningful company.

- 4/ What They Don't Teach You at Harvard Business School by Mark H. McCormack
  There's the way the world works "in theory." (School)
  And then there's the way the world actually works.
  This book is a wake-up call: relationships drive everything.

- 5/ How To Win Friends & Influence People by Dale Carnegie

- 6/ Think & Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill
  The fact this book isn't required reading in MBA programs blows my mind.
  In order to become successful, Hill says you must position your Chief Aim in your mind's eye.
  And obsessively pursue it.

- Shameless plug: I think our paid newsletter, Category Pirates üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è, is worth more than every MBA program on the planet.
  Even our reader's say so.
