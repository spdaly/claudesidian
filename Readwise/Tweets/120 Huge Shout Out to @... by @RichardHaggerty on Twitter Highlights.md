## Highlights
- 1/20 Huge shout out to @ChrisWillx for introducing me to @fortelabs. Just finished reading & implementing Building A `#`SecondBrain. 
  A brilliant book! Testament to Tiago's PARA and CODE system. Here's how it's improving all areas of life in 20 tweets.

- 2/20 Where things worked before reading `#`BASB:
  Solid productivity including monthly masterclasses for the business owners I coach and mentor where I:
  - Read 5 books a month to evaluate models
  - Examine where I've succeed/failed
  - Look up 200 research papers & pick the best 10 [View Tweet](https://readwise.io/open/362115982) ^rw362115982
- 3/20 Where things were a DISASTER before reading `#`BASB:
  - Over 11,500 @evernote notes
  - 15 GB of data on @Dropbox from 11+ years
  - 40,000+ photos
  - 100s of @simplemindapp Mind Maps
  - 30+ years of digital files
  - 2 MacBooks with different file structures
  - 1,000s of emails [View Tweet](https://readwise.io/open/362115983) ^rw362115983
- 4/20 With no uniform directory structure or system, each device & project was like wading through treacle. 
  Locating anything was PAINFUL, overwhelming and caused ongoing anxiety.
  I was in a double bind: how do you get organised AND find time to deliver on existing commitments? [View Tweet](https://readwise.io/open/362115984) ^rw362115984
- 5/20 Within a week, as I read Building A `#`SecondBrain, everything was taken care of - across all devices and systems.
  Such clarity and peace of mind. And projects coming to fruition!
  I starting to ask questions like "How can I apply PARA to my physical environments?"

- 6/20 Here's what happened:
  - I archived almost everything
  - I only have Projects where I am actively working on to deadlines (It's Summer & my 50th coming up, so a lot of socials)
  - I created one PARA structure that works across MacBooks & iPhone using @evernote & @Dropbox

- 7/20 To save time:
  - I use Evernote as my master structure for Projects and Areas
  - I mirror that structure on Dropbox
  - I implemented the same Dropbox structure on MacBooks (one folder on Desktop) and externals
  - I immediately applied "dialling down the scope" on projects [View Tweet](https://readwise.io/open/362115987) ^rw362115987
- 8/20 My MacBook Desktops after implementing PARA...
  My breathing is WAY calmer.
  My mind is still.
  And I can quietly getting things done.
  Peace of mind that I can outsource remembering.
  Most importantly, I am more more present for loved ones. I have more space & time for them

- 9/20 To implement PARA: I combined the Pragmatic Corner Marking Method of reading that Cal Newport teaches along with Tiago's Second Brain to embody Building A Second Brain.
  Cal Newport recently made this short video that explains his method:

- 10/20 I chose a physical copy of `#`BASB so there were no digital distractions, and marked it up as I go. 
  The Corner Marking Pragmatic Method in 4 steps:
  1. Read with a clear purpose in mind.
  2. When you find a section that interests you, add a line down the side next to it.

- 11/20
  3. When you want to draw attention to specific sentence or group of words, underline them.
  4. Mark the corner of the book whenever you mark up text at the side, so the page is easily discoverable.

- 12/20 What I love is that after 40 years of studying memory, reading skills, NLP, hypnosis & mind mapping etc., using Corner Marking is so efficient.
  Inter-acting with a physical book, & having it easily accessible in my library naturally becomes an extension of the `#`SecondBrain [View Tweet](https://readwise.io/open/362115992) ^rw362115992
- 13/20 To implement `#`PKM, I wrote 700+ words each day for 30 days to my email list:
  - I only wrote about my reactions, insights, process and learnings. 
  - I kept note making and reading separate:
  I wrote only after Deep Work style reading sessions using the Corner Marking Method [View Tweet](https://readwise.io/open/362115993) ^rw362115993
- 14/20 I was already integrating Cal Newport's Deep Work but been unable to get al my data organised. (I also have 10 huge physical bullet journals). 
  However, I was steadily developing O.R.D.E.R. where I focused on one thing, and cut out distractions:

- 15/20 The beauty of the `#`SecondBrain PARA approach is I have one place (`#`Evernote) to capture content and notes
  Everything I need is instantly accessible and easily organised
  Dropbox backs up all photos and screenshots to "Camera Uploads" so I can use them at once for projects [View Tweet](https://readwise.io/open/362115995) ^rw362115995
- 16/20 Building A `#`SecondBrain enables me to have great insight. I was able to see nuances using CODE and convergence and divergence which had eluded me. 
  And answer a pressing question that had vexed me:
  How to use @evernote and my mind mapping tool of choice @simplemindapp? [View Tweet](https://readwise.io/open/362115996) ^rw362115996
- 17/20 Here's how `#`BASB gave me great insight:
  - @evernote: Capture and Distil (freenote) into Evernote as I explore ideas (divergence)
  - @simplemindapp: Organise (assemble) ideas and Express (compile emails & blogs & deliver masterclasses) in the convergence phase
  `#`SecondBrain

- 18/20
  - All you create is a re-usable "asset"
  - Organise by what's actionable now (Projects)
  - Dial down the scope
  - Get out a draft for feedback ASAP
  - Integrating Cal Newport's Pragmatic Corner Marking Method for reading & @fortelabs's PARA system worked well on this project [View Tweet](https://readwise.io/open/362115998) ^rw362115998
- 19/20 The moment I create an Evernote Project Notebook, instantly create a note with this information:
  - Aim: 
  - Why this project?
  - What, specifically, is in scope? 
  - How will I know I have achieved this?
  - Who/what could be ideal models for me?
  - Where can I gather ideas now? [View Tweet](https://readwise.io/open/362115999) ^rw362115999
- 20/20 Thank you @fortelabs for such a brilliant system, well laid out book & your evident kindness & care. @ChrisWillx you already could see this. I loved your discussion with @MikhailaFuller about how to pronounce "Tiago". Because of that, I dived in and discovered `#`BASB :) [View Tweet](https://readwise.io/open/362116000) ^rw362116000
