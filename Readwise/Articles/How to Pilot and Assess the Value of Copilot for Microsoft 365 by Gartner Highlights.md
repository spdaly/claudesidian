## Highlights
- Interest in Copilot for Microsoft 365 is growing. However, for most, generative AI is new territory and significant questions remain on how to pilot and assess its value. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677686815) ^rw677686815
- ROI remains unclear [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677686855) ^rw677686855
- IT is being tasked to run pilots at considerable cost with minimal data about “what good looks like.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677686884) ^rw677686884
- M365 Copilot is not primarily about gaining new capabilities but rather about performing existing tasks more efficiently. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677686928) ^rw677686928
- Establish a cross-functional center of excellence (COE) for M365 Copilot as an extension of your Microsoft 365 product or digital workplace team. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677686977) ^rw677686977
- Assess your Microsoft 365 environment to ensure appropriate permissions management and governance controls are in place before starting your pilots. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677687004) ^rw677687004
- Select departments, processes and personas for pilots where you think M365 Copilot could add value. Establish a clear hypothesis for each pilot and define suitable KPIs so you can measure success. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677687017) ^rw677687017
- Use a hands-on approach when piloting M365 Copilot. Pilot users will need regular engagement and education (such as prompt training) to drive adoption and to establish new working practices. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677687063) ^rw677687063
- Monitor M365 Copilot usage and adoption, but do not just rely on quantitative data from monitoring tools (which are in their infancy). Balance with subjective feedback collected through surveys, focus groups and other qualitative activities to help determine value. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677687149) ^rw677687149
- Develop a data-driven approach for evaluating M365 Copilot impact, ROI and value. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677687441) ^rw677687441
- From summarizing meetings, emails and documents, to creating draft content in Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint, M365 Copilot promises a radical shift in terms of how users discover, create, consume and understand content. However, Copilot licenses are a substantial investment. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677687631) ^rw677687631
- Organizations that are looking to pilot M365 Copilot must do so with limited data about its effectiveness or an understanding of “what good looks like.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677687638) ^rw677687638
- Microsoft asserts that 70% of Copilot users said they were more productive, and 68% said it improved the quality of their work [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677688513) ^rw677688513
- Microsoft asserts that users with Copilot were 29% faster than those without it. On average, Microsoft concluded that pilot users recovered 14 minutes per day from using M365 Copilot. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677688630) ^rw677688630
- Gartner recommends caution when interpreting these results. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677689359) ^rw677689359
- “What do you think is the biggest risk/issue with deploying M365 Copilot?” Oversharing and exposing sensitive information to employees was the top identified risk. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677689374) ^rw677689374
- M365 Copilot can increase information risks. Copilot is only as good as the data in Microsoft 365. If this data has incorrect permissions, or includes redundant or out-of-date content, or if the large language model (LLM) simply gets things wrong, Copilot responses could result in oversharing and misinformation. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677689395) ^rw677689395
- “Unclear use cases leading to limited adoption and poor ROI” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677689409) ^rw677689409
- The goals of piloting M365 Copilot differ from a traditional IT pilot. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677690116) ^rw677690116
- The pilot itself is a substantial investment [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677690288) ^rw677690288
- High business expectations despite unclear use cases [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677690300) ^rw677690300
- IT must balance business interest in M365 Copilot with the practical realities of unclear use cases, considerable cost, time and resource implications and potential information risks. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677690308) ^rw677690308
- M365 Copilot introduces risks and issues: The better the information retrieval tool, the better your information governance needs to be. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677690319) ^rw677690319
- There is a significant risk that M365 Copilot’s ability to discover, recommend and summarize information across your tenant could increase oversharing and misinformation. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677690334) ^rw677690334
- Significant organizational change management (OCM) effort: Using GenAI represents a completely different way of working. Employees will have to change years of learned behavior, for example replacing a Google or knowledge base search with a series of natural language prompts and interactions with M365 Copilot [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677690350) ^rw677690350
- Uncertain how the pilot will scale [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677690386) ^rw677690386
- Microsoft 365 Copilot’s main promise is it makes workers more efficient at what they already do. It does not add new capabilities or fill obvious gaps in the way new systems often do. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677690396) ^rw677690396
- “How do I run an effective Microsoft 365 Copilot and Assess Value?” This guidance framework answers this question. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677690415) ^rw677690415
- A successful pilot needs to get to the heart of whether M365 Copilot will provide value for your organization and, if so, which users and groups are likely to benefit the most from it. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677690428) ^rw677690428
- for most organizations, there must be a focus on identifying the right personas, groups and departments who can really benefit from M365 Copilot. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677690515) ^rw677690515
- Before you can pilot M365 Copilot with end users, you need to define your M365 Copilot strategy and prepare your environment. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677692306) ^rw677692306
- M365 Copilot that has direct access to your organizational data stored in Microsoft 365. As such, M365 Copilot has the potential to provide significant value, but it also carries increased risks. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677693433) ^rw677693433
- The CoE will act as a foundation to develop use cases, knowledge and expertise for M365 Copilot, while implementing appropriate security and information governance controls. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677695790) ^rw677695790
- The CoE must be adequately resourced to effectively run the pilots and assess their value. Ensure there is manager support for staff to participate in the CoE and consider assigning project resources to assist. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677696131) ^rw677696131
- Gartner recommends a minimum of 50 to 100, depending on the size of your organization, to adequately pilot M365 Copilot with different groups and provide a meaningful assessment. One hundred M365 Copilot licenses equates to an annual spend of $36,000. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677697939) ^rw677697939
- Microsoft states that you must wait a minimum of 90 days before cycling user licenses. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677698053) ^rw677698053
- Be clear with your leadership that you will not necessarily see a return on your initial pilot investment for M365 Copilot. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677698139) ^rw677698139
- The focus during 2024 should be on infrastructure and security readiness, value assessment and understanding use cases and associated success criteria. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677698150) ^rw677698150
- Usage: How many pilot users are regularly using M365 Copilot as part of their role and if so, in what scenarios and with what M365 apps [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677698235) ^rw677698235
- However, beyond these requirements, there is a significant risk that your tenant contains overshared sensitive information that Copilot may expose. Indeed, in Gartner’s 2023 Microsoft 365 survey, almost 60% of respondents stated that oversharing, data loss and content sprawl were among the top three biggest risks to their M365 deployment. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677698522) ^rw677698522
- Use Microsoft Purview to apply data classification policies and sensitivity labels. M365 Copilot will respect encryption enforced through sensitivity labels, so if you encrypt sensitive information and restrict access, you will provide an additional layer of defense, which will prevent unauthorized access, even if the content is overshared. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677698564) ^rw677698564
- To mitigate this risk, Gartner recommends turning this feedback functionality off as part of the tenant readiness work. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677698794) ^rw677698794
- Like all GenAI models, M365 Copilot has a knowledge cutoff date for public data. While this does not impact its ability to reason over your organizational data, it does mean it could be unaware of the latest trends or developments, which could impact its answer. For example, it might recommend using an older PowerShell module. To mitigate this, M365 Copilot has an integration with Bing, which is enabled by default at the tenant level. This involves Copilot generating a search query to Bing and using results from the Bing search engine to provide up-to-date answers. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677698827) ^rw677698827
- However, this involves sending potentially sensitive business information to Bing, which is a separate Microsoft service from Microsoft 365. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677698852) ^rw677698852
- In conjunction with readying your Microsoft 365 tenant, begin a controlled trial or PoC of M365 Copilot with your M365 support team and those directly involved in supporting the CoE. For most organizations, this will likely involve no more than 20 users and run for 30 days. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677698917) ^rw677698917
- This is also a good time to engage with a small number of key M365 Community of Practice (CoP) members. These are trusted business users that you have established relationships with, having worked with them when rolling out other Microsoft 365 products. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677698974) ^rw677698974
- The next stage is to identify an initial group of end users for your first pilot. This stage is iterative, so Gartner recommends running several time bound (90-day) pilots, pausing after each to measure impact and value. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677698988) ^rw677698988
- You should also work with departments and business units to identify specific business processes that could be improved through M365 Copilot. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677700011) ^rw677700011
- Gartner does not recommend use cases that involve custom integration or extension of M365 Copilot to other systems during pilots. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677700330) ^rw677700330
- Some organizations report that there is significant business interest for M365 Copilot pilots and as such, there may be competition for Copilot licenses. If choosing between multiple candidate groups who have defined use cases for M365 Copilot, we recommend prioritizing areas that have a direct impact on the company’s bottom line. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677700997) ^rw677700997
- • Phase 1: A hands-on phase where you work closely with the pilot group to ideate and brainstorm use cases (step 4) and provide regular engagement, change management and training (step 5). This should last for a maximum of four weeks.
  • Phase 2: A hands-off period (four to six weeks) where you reduce engagement and allow the users to use M365 Copilot without significant prompts or interactions. Of course, you will have mechanisms (such as a Viva Engage community or a Teams channel) to answer any questions, but you will not be telling the group to “use Copilot.” This is important because it will help to determine whether users continue to adopt the technology when they are not being instructed to use it.
  • Phase 3: An evaluation period where you survey users and measure success (step 6). This will likely run for a maximum of two to three weeks. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677704373) ^rw677704373
- Note: What does the staffing/level of effort look like for this type of engagement?
- It is also imperative that they agree to take part in the evaluation period, participating in surveys and focus groups as required [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677708052) ^rw677708052
- Step 8: Report to Leadership [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/677715809) ^rw677715809
- Note: Report to leadership in step 8.
