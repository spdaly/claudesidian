## Highlights
- Not everyone sees these developments as a death knell for coding jobs. Armando Solar-Lezama, who, as the leader of M.I.T.’s Computer Assisted Programming Group, spends his days thinking about how to bring more automation into coding, said A.I. tools still lacked a lot of the essential skills of even junior programmers. His research has shown, for example, how large language models like GPT-4 failed to truly understand the problems they were solving with code and made sometimes ridiculous mistakes.
  “When you’re talking about more foundational skills, knowing how to reason about a piece of code, knowing how to track down a bug across a large system, those are things that the current models really don’t know how to do,” he said.

- Still, A.I. is changing how software is made. In one [study,](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4945566) an A.I. Coding assistant made developers 20 percent more productive. Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said [on a recent call](https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/alphabet-earnings-q3-2024/) with analysts that more than a quarter of the company’s new code was now generated by A.I., but reviewed and accepted by engineers.

- As with any discussion about automation, there are two ways people tend to forecast the outcomes of this development. Mr. Solar-Lezama believes that A.I. tools are good news for programming careers. If coding becomes easier, he argues, we’ll just make more, better software. We’ll use it to solve problems that wouldn’t have been worth the hassle previously, and standards will skyrocket. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/822450475) ^rw822450475
- The other view: “I think it’s pretty grim,” said Zach Sims, a co-founder of Codecademy, an online coding tutorial company. He was talking specifically about the job prospects for coding boot camp graduates. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/822450478) ^rw822450478
- Sometimes, the new coders he is tracking don’t even get the opportunity to do that. Because A.I.-generated code is riddled with errors that are hard to spot without experience, senior developers sometimes find it easier to generate and edit it themselves than to let it fall to a junior programmer.
