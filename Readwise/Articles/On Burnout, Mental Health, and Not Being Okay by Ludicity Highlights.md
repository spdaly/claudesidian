## Highlights
- By that weekend, I was staying with family, completely unable to care for myself. It took three days to go from a top-performer to being unsure if I'd have wasted away without help. I found a psychologist who was superior to the first, but was still barely able to help me with anything more than a few breathing exercises. Every day, my aunt would convince me to get out of bed, blessedly nag me until I ate *something*, and I would watch Brooklyn 99 all day because it tuned out the worst feelings until I was allowed to sleep again.

- One day I noticed that I felt a little bit better around 9PM. And the next day it was 8:40PM. Then 8:20PM, like clockwork. Maybe it was some weird circadian thing, but I'll never know. Each day I just held on desperately, trying to grind out a measly hundred words of my thesis per day, wanting to die, praying that I would feel *normal* again. And I kept getting better, until one day I woke up at 8AM, felt bad until 8:10AM, finished my thesis, and binged Pathfinder: Kingmaker to celebrate being human again. Neutral Good Human Ranger, and trash fantasy has never felt so good. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/742023438) ^rw742023438
