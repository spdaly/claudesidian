## Highlights
- In the past three years, there have been not one but two generational shifts in how work gets done, both of which were only possible because of decades of research and development. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/672599957) ^rw672599957
- The first shift occurred when COVID made us realize how powerful remote and hybrid work technologies had become, as well as how much science was available to guide us in how to (and how not to) use these technologies. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/672600068) ^rw672600068
- The second arrived this year, as it became clear that, at long last, generative AI had advanced to the point where it could be valuable to huge swaths of the work people do every day. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/672600072) ^rw672600072
- LLMs can substantially improve productivity on common information work tasks, although there are some qualifiers [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/672600282) ^rw672600282

- Copilot for M365 saves time for a variety of tasks in lab studies and surveys [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/672600499) ^rw672600499
- Tasks included meeting summarization, information retrieval, and content creation [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/672600526) ^rw672600526
- The evidence points to LLMs helping the least experienced the most [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/672600956) ^rw672600956
- The concept of “microproductivity”, in which complex tasks are decomposed into smaller subtasks and performed in “micromoments” by the person most skilled to do so, can be enhanced through automation (Teevan 2016). [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/672612439) ^rw672612439
