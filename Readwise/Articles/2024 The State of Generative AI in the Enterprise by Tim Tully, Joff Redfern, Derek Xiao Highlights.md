## Highlights
- 2024 marks the year that generative AI became a mission-critical imperative for the enterprise. The numbers tell a dramatic story: AI spending[1](https://menlovc.com/2024-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/?_bhlid=6130615d8c003b3c754e7b9f210f3b0f1652b47f`#`765bf53e-c1df-477f-941d-810743936402) surged to $13.8 billion this year, more than 6x the $2.3 billion spent in 2023—a clear signal that enterprises are shifting from experimentation to execution, embedding AI at the core of their business strategies.

- This spike in spending reflects a wave of organizational optimism; 72% of decision-makers anticipate broader adoption of generative AI tools in the near future. This confidence isn’t just speculative—generative AI tools are already deeply embedded in the daily work of professionals, from programmers to healthcare providers.

- Despite this positive outlook and increasing investment, many decision-makers are still figuring out what will and won’t work for their businesses. More than a third of our survey respondents do not have a clear vision for how generative AI will be implemented across their organizations. This doesn’t mean they’re investing without direction; it simply underscores that we’re still in the early stages of a large-scale transformation. Enterprise leaders are just beginning to grasp the profound impact generative AI will have on their organizations. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/835786831) ^rw835786831
- Despite ongoing experimentation, clear adoption trends point to a subset of use cases already delivering tangible ROI through enhanced productivity or operational efficiency:
  • **Code copilots** lead the charge with 51% adoption, making developers AI’s earliest power users. [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)’s rapid ascent to a $300 million revenue run rate validates this trajectory, while emerging tools like [Codeium](https://codeium.com/) and [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) are also growing fast. Beyond general coding assistants, enterprises are also purchasing task-specific copilots like [Harness](https://menlovc.com/portfolio/harness/)’* AI DevOps Engineer and QA Assistant for pipeline generation and test automation, as well as AI agents like [All Hands](https://menlovc.com/portfolio/all-hands-ai/)* that are able to perform more end-to-end software development.
  • **Support chatbots** have captured significant usage, with 31% enterprise adoption. These applications deliver reliable, 24/7, knowledge-based support for internal employees and external customers. [Aisera](https://menlovc.com/portfolio/aisera/),* [Decagon](https://decagon.ai/), and [Sierra](https://sierra.ai/)’s agents interact directly with end customers, while [Observe AI](https://menlovc.com/portfolio/observe-ai/)* supports contact center agents with real-time guidance during calls.
  • **Enterprise search + retrieval** and **data extraction + transformation** (28% and 27%, respectively) reflect a strong drive to unlock and harness the valuable knowledge hidden within data silos scattered across organizations. Solutions like [Glean](https://www.glean.com/) and [Sana](https://menlovc.com/portfolio/sana-labs/)* connect to emails, messengers, and document stores—enabling unified semantic search across disparate systems and delivering AI-powered knowledge management.
  • **Meeting summarization** ranks fifth in use cases (24% adoption), saving time and boosting productivity by automating note-taking and takeaways. Tools like [Fireflies.ai](https://fireflies.ai/), [Otter.ai](https://otter.ai/), and Sana capture and summarize online meetings, while [Fathom](https://www.fathom.video/) distills key points from videos. [Eleos Health](https://menlovc.com/portfolio/eleos-health/)* applies this innovation to healthcare, automating hours of documentation and integrating directly with EHRs so that healthcare providers can focus on patient care.
