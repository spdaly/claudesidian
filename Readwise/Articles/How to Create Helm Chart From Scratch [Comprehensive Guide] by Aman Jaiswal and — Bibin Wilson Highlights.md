## Highlights
- Helm charts are a combination of [Kubernetes YAML manifest](https://devopscube.com/create-kubernetes-yaml/) templates and helm-specific files. You can call it a helm package.

Helm uses the [go templating engine](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) for the templating functionality. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/473876631) ^rw473876631
