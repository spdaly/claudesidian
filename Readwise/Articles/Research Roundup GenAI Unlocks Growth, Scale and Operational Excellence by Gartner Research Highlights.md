- Generative AI (GenAI) is reshaping markets, industries and the technology provider landscape. Tech CEOs should leverage GenAI technology internally and in their products and services, enabling them to augment capacities for process improvements, accelerate business growth and automate for increasingly autonomous operations (see Figure 1):
  • GenAI can improve business capabilities and increase efficiency by augmenting tech CEO’s functional operations, such as software engineering, service delivery, sales, marketing and general enablement-related functions.
  • GenAI presents tech CEOs with the opportunity to accelerate growth with faster product cycles and by shortening the time it takes to move from problem-solution fit to product-market fit. Successful tech CEOs will be those who swiftly adopt and act to gain an advantage.
  • GenAI enables the aspiration of fully autonomous operations for tech CEOs. GenAI-native businesses are likely to outcompete legacy organizations within five years, reimagining every operational process that can be automated by GenAI.
