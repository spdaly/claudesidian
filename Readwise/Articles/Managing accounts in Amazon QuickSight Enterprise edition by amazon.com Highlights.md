## Highlights
- With IAM Identity Center, add users to QuickSight by associating their IAM Identity Center group or groups to a reader, author, or admin role in QuickSight. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/661149858) ^rw661149858
- If you are using IAM Identity Center or Active Directory, you can also manage users through groups. To create multiple accounts at once, choose one or more Active Directory groups to assign a role in Amazon QuickSight. All users in the selected groups are authorized to sign in to Amazon QuickSight. You can also add accounts individually by adding users to Active Directory groups that are already integrated with Amazon QuickSight. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/661149929) ^rw661149929
- If you are using IAM Identity Center or Active Directory groups, you can instead move a user into the appropriate group. To do this, you need both administrative privileges in Amazon QuickSight and also appropriate AWS permissions. Some limitations apply on upgrading or downgrading user access in this automated way.

- With IAM Identity Center integrated users, you can change role types for a user by moving them to a group that is associated with a different QuickSight role. If a user belongs to multiple groups that are mapped to different role types, the user is able to access QuickSight with the role that offers the broadest level of access.
