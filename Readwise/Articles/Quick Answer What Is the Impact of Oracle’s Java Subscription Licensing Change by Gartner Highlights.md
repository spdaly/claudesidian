## Highlights
- On 23 January 2023, Oracle quietly released an updated Oracle Java subscription price list introducing a significant change to its Java licensing model. Oracle’s Java subscription is now available as Oracle Java SE Universal Subscription with a single Employee metric and a limit of up to 50,000 processors. The subscription includes usage across desktops, servers and third-party cloud deployments. This is a change from the legacy Java SE Desktop Subscription and Java SE Subscription, which were licensed via Named User Plus/Desktop and Processor metrics respectively.

- The Employee metric is not new for Oracle, as this license model already exists for E-Business Suite, PeopleSoft and Fusion Cloud applications, such as HCM. The Employee metric requires licensing of all employees in an organization, regardless of whether they use Oracle Java or not. The employee population is defined as all of your employees and all agents, contractors, outsourcers and consultants that support your internal business operations.2 An organization of 45,000 employees (40,000 full-time, part-time and temporary employees plus 5,000 agents, contractors and consultants), of which 4,500 use a chargeable version of Java, will now require 45,000 licenses. The annual net fee for these 45,000 licenses is $2,835,000 (stated volume discount of 65% applied). [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/588349112) ^rw588349112
