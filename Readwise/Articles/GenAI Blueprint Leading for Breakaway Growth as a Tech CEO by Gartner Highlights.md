## Highlights
- The 2023 Gartner GenAI Impact on Tech Providers survey unearthed a seemingly contradictory insight: organizations investing heavily in GenAI and integrating it deeply were more inclined to perceive market expectations for the technology as unrealistic (see Figure 1). However, this viewpoint does not call into question GenAIâ€™s disruptive potential. Tech CEOs participating in the survey unanimously acknowledged the extensive opportunity that GenAI offers across their own operations as well as product performance and delivery. The divergence in opinion is reflected in vendorsâ€™ strategies for effectively harnessing this disruptive potential (see Note 1 for definitions of top and trailing performers).

- **Deeper integration for scale:** These organizations embed GenAI more deeply into their operations â€” including workflows, data and customer interfaces. They automate GenAI processes to shift their team to higher-ROI tasks while simultaneously empowering them with faster and better insights to achieve greater impact across the entire customer journey. These organizations achieve greater scale and synergy from their investments, positioning them to maximize the disruptive potential of GenAI. This approach was more prevalent among the top performers in our GenAI survey, those that achieved double-digit growth in 2023 and had a stronger commercial outlook for 2024.

- The primary insights for this research were from Gartnerâ€™s 2023 GenAI Impact on Tech Providers Survey. The analysis segmented respondents below $100M in revenue into top and trailing performers. Top performers were those organizations that grew >10% in 2023, expected continued growth in 2024 and were also more likely to have confidence in their ability to execute, raise capital and lead in their markets. Trailing performers grew less than 10% in 2023 were less likely to expect growth in 2024. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/728793836) ^rw728793836
