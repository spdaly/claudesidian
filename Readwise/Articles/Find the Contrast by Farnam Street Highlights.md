## Highlights
- Will Ahmed on what success means:
  *“ Success is being excited to go to work and being excited to come home.”* [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/844213421) ^rw844213421 
- See also: [[quote]] 
- Vincent Van Gogh on the accumulation of small things:
  *“Great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought together. The trick is to focus on the first small thing. Starting small is still starting, and small beginnings often lead to extraordinary endings.”* [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/844213457) ^rw844213457

- Note: Interesting quote to relate to genAI adoption.

- Good ideas taken too far often cause unanticipated consequences. Wielding leverage to maximum effect all the time, as the West Virginia mine owners did, sows the seeds of ongoing unrest that undermines one’s ability to be truly effective. No one wants to feel exploited, and those who are never give their loyalty or their best work. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/844213794) ^rw844213794
