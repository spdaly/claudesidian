## Highlights
- The popular history of technology usually starts with the personal computer, and for good reason: that was the first high tech device that most people ever used. The only thing more impressive than the sheer audacity of “A computer on every desk and in every home” as a corporate goal, is the fact that Microsoft accomplished it, with help from its longtime competitor Apple.

- These are bookkeepers and and tellers at a bank in 1908; fast forward three decades and technology had advanced: [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/806250592) ^rw806250592
- The new system of maintaining checking accounts in the National Safety Bank and Trust Company, of New York, known as the “Checkmaster,” was so well received that the bank has had to increase its staff and equipment. Instead of maintaining a mininum balance, the depositor is charged a small service charge for each entry on his statement. To date, the bank has attracted over 30,000 active accounts. Bookkeepers are shown as they post entries on “Checkmaster” accounts. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/806250871) ^rw806250871
- It’s striking how the first response to a process change is to come up with a business model predicated on covering new marginal costs; only later do companies tend to consider the larger picture, like how low-marginal-cost checking accounts might lead to more business for the bank overall, the volume of which can be supported thanks to said new technology.

- However, this 1970 picture was one of the last images of its kind: by the time this picture was taken, Bank of America, where this picture was taken, was already well on its way to transitioning all of its accounting and bookkeeping to computers; most of corporate America soon followed, with the two primary applications being accounting and enterprise resource planning. Those were jobs that had been primarily done by hand; now they were done by computers, and the hands were no longer needed. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/806251592) ^rw806251592
- the expectation is not that the computer does your work for you, but rather that the computer enables you to do your work better and more efficiently. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/806253110) ^rw806253110
- Note: Conversely, the computer enables you to do your work better and more efficiently not that it does the work for you.
- that computers are an aid to humans, not their replacement [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/806253358) ^rw806253358
- Note: This has now changed in light of genAI advances. "Computers" have become a viable replacement for humans in more mundane tasks. But the achievement of Full Replacement seems to be more in reach than ever before.
- You can think of Copilot as the UI for AI. It helps you break down these siloes between your work artifacts, your communications, and your business processes. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/806254313) ^rw806254313

- The initial wave of personal computers were little more than toys, including the Commodore 64 and TRS-80, sold in your local Radio Shack; the Apple I, released in 1976, was initially sold as a bare circuit board: [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/806254332) ^rw806254332
