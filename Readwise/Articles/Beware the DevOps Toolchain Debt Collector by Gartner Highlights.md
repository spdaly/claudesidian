## Highlights
- Beware the DevOps Toolchain Debt Collector [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/566579222) ^rw566579222
- Even after successful pilots, organizations find it hard to manage and scale DevOps toolchains. To meet each DevOps activity, most organizations build toolchains consisting of disparate, independent tools with overlapping features and functional gaps. As vendors evolve the functionality of their tools, the overlaps and gaps increase, leaving organizations with redundant and complex toolchains that slow down delivery complexity.
  The complexities of managing such tools force developers and engineers to divert their time to toolchain and tooling maintenance tasks instead of focusing on customer-centric innovation. These outdated toolchains further increase overhead costs, magnify technical risks, add operational toil and limit business agility. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/566574825) ^rw566574825
