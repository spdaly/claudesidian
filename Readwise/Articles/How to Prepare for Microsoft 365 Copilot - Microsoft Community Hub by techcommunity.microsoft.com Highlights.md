## Highlights
- To use Copilot, your organization must meet some technical requirements and have some features enabled. Copilot users must have either a Microsoft 365 E3 or E5 license [1],â€¯and an Azure Active Directory account, which gives them access to the Microsoft 365 apps and services that work with Copilot including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneDrive, Outlook, Loop, and more. Once available to your organization, your users will need to be on the Current Channel or Monthly Enterprise Channel [2] for Microsoft 365 apps to have access to Copilot in desktop clients. Learn more about the channels in [this article](https://learn.microsoft.com/deployoffice/updates/overview-update-channels). [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670058316) ^rw670058316
