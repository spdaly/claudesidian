## Highlights
- This is why Microsoft released a new engine, **WSL2,** which is based on a more traditional approach of a lightweight virtual machine running an unmodified Linux kernel plus some kernel modules to better integrate on Windows [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/452871156) ^rw452871156
- Now that we have a clearer understanding of how Docker manages the filesystem, it is easily understandable **how risky** it can be to use a **container without proper data persistency** layer. This is exactly where docker volumes come in handy. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/452872155) ^rw452872155
- Bind mounting is the core of all problems of bad filesystem performance. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/452872303) ^rw452872303
- Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. While [bind mounts](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) depend on the host machine’s directory structure and OS, volumes are completely managed by Docker. Volumes have several advantages over bind mounts: [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/452872433) ^rw452872433

- • Bind mounts are the most natural way to move our files inside a container, but they suffer severe performance issues caused by file system sharing when the Docker engine runs in a VM.
  • Volumes are way faster than bind mounts, but they lack the basics of the development experience (e.g., You and your local editor cannot see the files outside the container) [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/452872531) ^rw452872531
