## Highlights
- Retrieval-augmented generation workflow. This study investigates the contribution of each component and provides insights into optimal RAG practices through extensive experimentation. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/742020296) ^rw742020296 
- See also: [[retrieval augmented generation]] [[artificial intelligence]] 
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses these challenges by retrieving relevant documents from external knowledge bases, providing accurate, real-time, domain-specific context to LLMs [6] [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/742014231) ^rw742014231 
- See also: [[retrieval augmented generation]] 
- Document chunking and embedding methods significantly impact retrieval performance. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/742014287) ^rw742014287
- In this paper, we focus on best practices for applying RAG methods, advancing the understanding and application of RAG in LLMs. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/742020194) ^rw742020194
- Not all queries require retrieval-augmented due to the inherent capabilities of LLMs. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/742020247) ^rw742020247
- Retrieval is generally recommended when knowledge beyond the modelâ€™s parameters is needed. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/742020406) ^rw742020406
- Chunking documents into smaller segments is crucial for enhancing retrieval precision and avoiding length issues in LLMs. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/742020451) ^rw742020451
- Chunk size significantly impacts performance. Larger chunks provide more context, enhancing comprehension but increasing process time. Smaller chunks improve retrieval recall and reduce time but may lack sufficient context. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/742020471) ^rw742020471
- Faithfulness measures whether the response is hallucinated or matches the retrieved texts. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/742020575) ^rw742020575
- Relevancy measures whether the retrieved texts and responses match queries. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/742020582) ^rw742020582
- Techniques like small-to-big and sliding window improve retrieval quality by maintaining context and ensuring relevant information is retrieved. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/742020603) ^rw742020603
- Our evaluation indicates that Milvus stands out as the most comprehensive solution among the databases evaluated, meeting all the essential criteria and outperforming other open-source options. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/742020666) ^rw742020666
- According to our experimental findings, we suggest two distinct recipes or practices for implementing RAG systems, each customized to address specific requirements: one focusing on maximizing performance, and the other on striking a balance between efficiency and efficacy.
