## Highlights
- *Deep learning* is an advanced form of machine learning that tries to emulate the way the human brain learns. The key to deep learning is the creation of an artificial *neural network* that simulates electrochemical activity in biological neurons by using mathematical functions [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729658389) ^rw729658389
- Each neuron is a function that operates on an input value (***x***) and a *weight* (***w***). The function is wrapped in an *activation* function that determines whether to pass the output on. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729658417) ^rw729658417
- deep learning involves fitting training data to a function that can predict a label (***y***) based on the value of one or more features (***x***). The function (***f(x)***) is the outer layer of a nested function in which each layer of the neural network encapsulates functions that operate on ***x*** and the weight (***w***) values associated with them. The algorithm used to train the model involves iteratively feeding the feature values (***x***) in the training data forward through the layers to calculate output values for ***ŷ***, validating the model to evaluate how far off the calculated ***ŷ*** values are from the known ***y*** values (which quantifies the level of error, or *loss*, in the model), and then modifying the weights (***w***) to reduce the loss. The trained model includes the final weight values that result in the most accurate predictions. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729658605) ^rw729658605
- The weights in a neural network are central to how it calculates predicted values for labels. During the training process, the model *learns* the weights that will result in the most accurate predictions. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729658763) ^rw729658763
