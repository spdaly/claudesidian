## Highlights
- Amundsen is a *data discovery and metadata engine* for improving the productivity of data analysts, data scientists and engineers when interacting with data. It does that today by indexing data resources (tables, dashboards, streams, etc.) and powering a page-rank style search based on usage patterns (e.g. highly queried tables show up earlier than less queried tables). Think of it as **Google search for data**. The project is named after Norwegian explorer [Roald Amundsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Amundsen), the first person to discover the South Pole.
