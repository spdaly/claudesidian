  **Introduction**
  **Download the attachment to access a tool that ingests the insights from Gartner’s Enterprise AI survey to help you increase the effectiveness of your AI opportunity qualification.**
  Enterprise prospects and customers with underdeveloped AI capabilities struggle to successfully implement and maintain AI projects. This issue is exacerbated by two trends: the rushed implementation of generative AI (GenAI) projects to appease stakeholders, and the disillusionment with GenAI due to an over-indexing on productivity versus business outcomes.
