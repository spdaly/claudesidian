## Highlights
- Azure Policy enables you to define both individual policies and groups of related policies, known as initiatives. Azure Policy evaluates your resources and highlights resources that aren't compliant with the policies you've created. Azure Policy can also prevent noncompliant resources from being created.

- if you set an Azure Policy on a resource group, all resources created within that resource group will automatically receive the same policy. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/722720423) ^rw722720423
- Azure Policy also evaluates and monitors all current VMs in your environment, including VMs that were created before the policy was created. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/722720503) ^rw722720503
- An Azure Policy initiative is a way of grouping related policies together. The initiative definition contains all of the policy definitions to help track your compliance state for a larger goal. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/722720576) ^rw722720576
