## Highlights
- What the large language models are good at is saying what an answer should sound 'like', which is different from what an answer should 'be' [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/627370566) ^rw627370566

- How did it fail? It simply didn’t have an underlying Mental Model of the World. On reflection, this is what my interview questions have always been about. I’m not interested in trivia knowledge. I’m not interested in Tools Used. I’m not interested in a few properly composed buzz-words [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/627370733) ^rw627370733
