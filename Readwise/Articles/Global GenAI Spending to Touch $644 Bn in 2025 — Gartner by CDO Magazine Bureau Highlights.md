## Highlights
- Global spending on generative AI (GenAI) is expected to skyrocket to $644 billion in 2025, a 76.4% increase over 2024, according to a new forecast from Gartner. The surge will be led by hardware investments, with AI-capable devices and servers accounting for nearly 80% of total spending. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/881143326) ^rw881143326
- Despite this explosive growth, Lovelock warns that enterprise enthusiasm for GenAI is being tempered by high failure rates in internal proof-of-concept (PoC) projects. “Expectations for GenAI's capabilities are declining due to high failure rates and dissatisfaction with results,” he says. Issues such as poor data quality, user resistance, and unclear ROI have derailed many early efforts. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/881143345) ^rw881143345
