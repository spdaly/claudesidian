## Highlights
- In recent years, the rapid development of large language model (LLM) has demonstrated superior performance in language understanding, text generation, planning, reasoning, and knowledge integration. This has led to the emergence of intelligent agents based on LLM. By leveraging the capabilities of LLM, these agents can effectively make decisions based on given objectives and possess certain learning and adaptation abilities.

- adopting multi-agent systems proves to be more effective: through collaboration among multiple agents, each undertaking specific tasks, complex problems can be efficiently managed through interaction and coordination. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/785098535) ^rw785098535
- LLM-based agents have significantly enhanced natural language processing, facilitating more efficient communication and interaction between agents and humans [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/785259393) ^rw785259393
- an agent is a fundamental concept referring to a system capable of perceiving its environment and making decisions based on the perceived information to achieve specific objectives. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/785098931) ^rw785098931
- In multi-agent systems, complex problems can be decomposed into multiple sub-problems and assigned to agents with expertise in specific domains. This allows each agent to perform optimally within its domain. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/785259476) ^rw785259476
- Multi-agent systems can dynamically reassign tasks based on environmental changes or task requirements, continually adapting to current objectives. This flexible response mechanism endows multi-agent systems with strong adaptability. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/785259620) ^rw785259620
- The research on multi-agent systems originated in the 1970s, where it was explored as a branch of distributed artificial intelligence. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/785259661) ^rw785259661
- LLM support multiple communication paradigms, including competitive, cooperative, and debate-based paradigms, selecting the appropriate one based on the specific task needs to facilitate agent interactions. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/785259929) ^rw785259929
