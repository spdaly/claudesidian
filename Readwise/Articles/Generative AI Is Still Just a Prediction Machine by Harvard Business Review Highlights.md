## Highlights
- What tasks can be done by AI, what will humans still need to do, and what are the sustainable sources of competitive advantage as AI continues to improve? [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/826434538) ^rw826434538
- Thinking of computers as arithmetic machines is more important than most people intuitively grasp because that understanding is fundamental to using computers effectively, whether for work or entertainment. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/826434838) ^rw826434838
- AIâ€™s evolution has mirrored this trajectory, with many early applications directly related to well-established prediction tasks and, more recently, AI reframing a wide number of applications as predictions [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/826434858) ^rw826434858
- The [efficacy of predictions is contingent on the underlying data](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24626/w24626.pdf). The quality and quantity of data significantly impact the accuracy of AI predictions. As AI models consume vast amounts of data, they learn patterns and make increasingly accurate predictions. The more diverse, comprehensive, and relevant the data, the better the AI performs. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/826435471) ^rw826435471
- With generative AI, the focus on data quality becomes even more critical. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/826435615) ^rw826435615
- While AI excels at making predictions and generating content, it cannot replace human judgment. In detecting credit card fraud, an AI can predict the likelihood that a particular transaction is fraud. Human judgment is needed to then assess whether to deny the transaction. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/826435658) ^rw826435658
- The generative models are good at providing information about store hours. However, the same chatbot might fail in high-stakes situations, such as addressing sensitive customer complaints, where nuanced human judgment is crucial. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/826435706) ^rw826435706
- Organizations with good judgment will thrive as AI diffuses. With generative AI, this is more important now than ever. Generative AI will enable each person to have much more reach and take many more actions. People will be able to send many more emails, create much more content, and oversee many more decisions. In other words, The judgment of each person in the organization will be amplified. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/826435725) ^rw826435725
