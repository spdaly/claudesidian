## Highlights
- GenAI brings a new wave of productivity capabilities to employees. Copilot for Microsoft 365 and Gemini for Google Workspace (formerly Duet AI)3 will disrupt knowledge management and content creation while augmenting employees‚Äô digital dexterity and leveling up their skills. The promise of GenAI is that it will upskill digital workers and accelerate their time to proficiency in new roles. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/707230217) ^rw707230217
- 76% of employees somewhat or strongly agreeing that they wished their software would increase the amount of AI in their applications (Gartner 2023 User Behavior and Influence Survey) [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/707506341) ^rw707506341
- **Strategic Planning Assumption:** By 2026, Microsoft‚Äôs Copilot for Microsoft 365 and Google‚Äôs Gemini for Google Workspace will have achieved less than 20% penetration of their active, enterprise user bases. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/707139679) ^rw707139679
- Set expectations with employees eager to adopt GenAI by communicating plans for investigating, piloting and deploying Copilot for Microsoft 365 and Gemini for Google Workspace. Assess other GenAI tools being deployed through business applications and how they overlap or supplement Copilot and Gemini. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/707506994) ^rw707506994

- Emerging technologies are often complex and require specialized knowledge and expertise to understand and implement effectively, but the most recent Gartner Digital Worker Survey found only approximately 12% of the workforce is ‚Äúdigitally dexterous.‚Äù Gartner defines this as having the digital expertise necessary to use technology to solve business problems (for example, a customer service rep who builds a no-code automation to improve speed of resolution). As features that leverage GenAI or smart devices appear in vendor roadmaps across multiple markets, the workforce must be able to use them effectively to have positive business impact.

- Digital workplace leaders sit at the center of this tension. They are responsible for creating digital workplace experiences that enable working from anywhere. At the same time, they must satisfy the demands of executive leaders who want measured, sensible technology investments in a physical space that entice employees and make their organizations ready for an office return. Put simply, without knowing what will happen, make everyone happy. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/707506996) ^rw707506996

- By December 2019 when this report was published, Gartner had multiple years of survey data showing how employees‚Äô preferences had shifted with regard to their preferred work location and the tools they use to get work done. Technology had also matured to the point where it was now feasible for many ‚Äúoffice‚Äù workers to work from anywhere without limiting their productivity.
