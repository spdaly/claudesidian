## Highlights
- Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. It's also one of the pillars of the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/722717902) ^rw722717902
- Predictability in the cloud lets you move forward with confidence. Predictability can be focused on performance predictability or cost predictability. Both performance and cost predictability are heavily influenced by the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/722717950) ^rw722717950
- Performance predictability focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience for your customers. Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability are just some of the cloud concepts that support performance predictability [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/722717959) ^rw722717959
- Cost predictability is focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend. With the cloud, you can track your resource use in real time, monitor resources to ensure that youâ€™re using them in the most efficient way, and apply data analytics to find patterns and trends that help better plan resource deployments [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/722717962) ^rw722717962
