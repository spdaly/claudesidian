- Generative AI has made machines conversational, and they are quickly moving from being our tools to becoming our teammates. Machines are no longer limited to tasks like crunching numbers and providing information. With generative AI capabilities, machines can also be our consultants, protectors, coaches, friends, therapists, bosses or customers. Machines are going from what they can DO for us to what they can BE for us. This is a big shift that comes with a potential dark side, as machines can also be job killers, bullies, liars, thieves and spies. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/640873396) ^rw640873396
