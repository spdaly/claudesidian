## Highlights
- A.I. is one of many technologies that promise transformation through iteration rather than disruption. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/871031500) ^rw871031500
- A.I. is one of many technologies that promise transformation through iteration rather than disruption. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/871031527) ^rw871031527
- Mid tech‚Äôs best innovation is a threat. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/871033478) ^rw871033478
- The economists Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo [call these kinds of technological fizzles](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/lure-so-so-technology-and-how-to-avoid-it) ‚Äúso-so‚Äù technologies. They change some jobs. They‚Äôre kind of nifty for a while. Eventually they become background noise or are flat-out annoying, say, when you‚Äôre bagging two weeks‚Äô worth of your own groceries. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/871032282) ^rw871032282
- That‚Äôs a mid revolution of mid tasks. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/871032342) ^rw871032342
- A.I.‚Äôs most revolutionary potential is helping experts apply their expertise better and faster. But for that to work, there has to be experts. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/871033622) ^rw871033622
- Hype isn‚Äôt held to account for being accurate, only for being compelling. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/871033630) ^rw871033630

- The problem is that asking the right questions requires the opposite of having zero education. You can‚Äôt just learn how to craft a prompt for an A.I. chatbot without first having the experience, exposure and, yes, education to know what the heck you are doing. The reality ‚Äî and the science ‚Äî is clear that learning is a messy, nonlinear human development process that resists efficiency. A.I. cannot replace it.

- But A.I. is a parasite [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/871033715) ^rw871033715
- A.I.‚Äôs hype is that its most compelling use case is starving the host [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/871033714) ^rw871033714
- Its wide adoption ‚Äî and its midness ‚Äî is threatening to topple an already fragile but important model of peer-reviewed research, deliberate scholarship and well-educated expertise. Which is just what we need in the post-fact era: less research and more predicting what we want to hear. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/871032633) ^rw871032633
- it promises the power to control what learning does without paying the cost for how real learning happens. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/871036506) ^rw871036506
- Note: **Is artificial intelligence a transformative technology, or is it merely a "mid" technology that offers mediocre improvements and risks undermining expertise and worker morale?** 
  Artificial intelligence is currently viewed as a "mid" technology, providing only modest enhancements rather than groundbreaking advancements. While it has potential in specific fields like healthcare, many of its applications lead to mundane tasks that do not significantly boost productivity. Furthermore, the hype around A.I. risks undermining the value of expertise and can negatively impact worker morale by labeling them as unnecessary.
- A.I. may be a mid technology with limited use cases to justify its financial and environmental costs. But it is a stellar tool for demoralizing workers who can, in the blink of a digital eye, be categorized as waste. Whatever A.I. has the potential to become, in this political environment it is most powerful when it is aimed at demoralizing workers.

- But we now live in a world where political might makes right. DOGE‚Äôs monthslong infomercial for A.I. reveals the difference that power can make to a mid technology. It does not have to be transformative to change how we live and work. In the wrong hands, mid tech is an antilabor hammer. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/871033345) ^rw871033345
