## Highlights
- Many GenAI applications sit atop a large language model (LLM) called generative pretrained transformer (GPT). [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670095562) ^rw670095562
- GenAIâ€™s underlying technologies include the LLMs themselves (of which there are a growing number, commercial and open-source, generic and domain-specific), natural language processing and massive computing using GPUs. Of course, the model requires an enormous amount of digitized content, which comes from the public internet, books and other information sources. Human trends have also converged: our willingness to talk to computers to accomplish tasks, the desire for a better user experience in information retrieval and increased productivity with less burnout.
