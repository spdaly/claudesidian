## Highlights
- Artificial intelligence, or AI, is concerned with building systems that simulate intelligent behavior. It encompasses a wide range of approaches, including those based on logic, search, and probabilistic reasoning [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/638633320) ^rw638633320
- Machine learning is a subset of AI that learns to make decisions by fitting mathematical models to observed data. This area has seen explosive growth and is now (incorrectly) almost synonymous with the term AI. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/638633436) ^rw638633436
- ke decisions by fitting mathematical models to observed data. This area has seen explosive growth and is now (incorrectly) almost synonymous with the term AI. A deep neural network is a type of machine learning model, and when it is fitted
  to data, this is referred to as deep learning [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/638633632) ^rw638633632
- Machine learning methods can coarsely be divided into three areas: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/638633688) ^rw638633688
- Supervised learning models define a mapping from input data to an output prediction. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/638633714) ^rw638633714
