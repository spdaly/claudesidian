## Highlights
- The shift-left model can incorporate any type of test—from code-level unit and API tests to UI-level browser tests—though many organizations prioritize browser tests in order to quickly expand their test suites. These types of tests interact with your application’s UI, mimicking customer interactions with key workflows like creating a new account or adding items to a cart. But creating tests with meaningful coverage can be more challenging than teams initially expect, and the infrastructure for executing them becomes more complex as an application grows.
