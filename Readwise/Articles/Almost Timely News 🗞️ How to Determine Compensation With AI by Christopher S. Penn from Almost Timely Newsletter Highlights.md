## Highlights
- We need to research appropriate compensation for this job description based on the job title, job description, location, company, and the candidate‚Äôs qualifications from their CV. Using all available payroll and salary data in the last calendar year (from 2024-09-06 onward) including credible commentary and discussions about this job description, search and produce an analysis of the quartiles of compensation appropriate for this job. Sources might include but should not be limited to Salary.com and similar sites, Glassdoor, Brass Ring, HRIS, SHRM, career forums, government data, private company payroll data, labor statistics, and other high quality compensation data resources. Compensation analysis should be broken into base pay, bonuses, benefits, and total compensation. Order your results in order of base pay in descending order. Based on the candidate CV and the job description, identify where in the pay continuum the candidate would most likely fall, and what, if any, justifications the candidate could use to achieve a higher base pay, more benefits, more bonuses, or higher total compensation. Double check your work and provide an assessment of how you mitigated known biases against protected classes such as race, gender, ethnicity, etc. to prevent pay disparity and pay inequity in your compensation evaluation. Cite your sources at the end as end notes. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/935476067) ^rw935476067
