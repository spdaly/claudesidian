## Highlights
- Generative AI technologies are emerging rapidly and promise substantial value. Like broader AI, GenAI permeates the entire technology stack and most industry verticals. Technology leaders can use this high-level guide and accompanying Emerging Market Quadrants to explore the vendor landscape. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/795888126) ^rw795888126
- Strategic Planning Assumptions
  * * *
  • By 2027, the number of companies using open-source AI directly (not indirectly via other vendors) will increase tenfold.
  • By 2027, GenAI will facilitate an increased use of other AI technologies (aside from GenAI) by 400%. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/795888362) ^rw795888362
- GenAI is not a market per se; it permeates the entire technology stack and most verticals. This new way to interface with technology is disrupting the technology usage patterns for both consumers and workers. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/795888591) ^rw795888591
- Gartner defines generative AI as technologies that “can generate new derived versions of content, strategies, designs and methods by learning from large repositories of original source content. GenAI has profound impacts on the business including content discovery, creation, authenticity and regulations; automation of human work; and the customer and employee experience.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/795888595) ^rw795888595
- The research in LLMs and large action models (LAMs) has been progressing rapidly over the last year and driving the advent of generative agent platforms in 2024 [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/795888643) ^rw795888643
- While GPT-based capabilities illustrate the massive opportunity for LLMs being used in reinventing the interface with technology, generative agents will revolutionize how business processes become intelligently autonomous/semiautonomous. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/795888653) ^rw795888653
- The opportunities for monetizing generative models are presently peaking, and the investment and competition are intensifying. The leaders in model quality and versatility are companies that have been aggressive in internet data collection to support the massive task of training and fine-tuning LLMs. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/795888723) ^rw795888723
- Open-source options are very attractive for companies piloting and proving use cases, as well as for enterprises who have experienced engineering and operations teams that can take on the operational maintenance of the models (including testing) and even contribute to the projects.
