## Highlights
- This perspective, while perhaps not entirely mistaken, misses the
  larger picture. Finding ways to produce goods and services with fewer resources—improving what we’ll call production efficiency—is the force behind some of the largest and most consequential changes in human history. Efficiency is the engine that powers human civilization. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/932897798) ^rw932897798
- During the American Civil War, more than two-thirds of the 660,000 deaths were attributed to infection, and infection killed between 12 and 15 percent of wounded soldiers treated in frontline hospitals in World War I.1 [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/932897868) ^rw932897868
- As the time, effort, and resources required to produce goods
  and services have fallen, they’ve become cheaper and more widely available, giving rise to a world of incredible abundance. And it is this abundance that makes modern life possible. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/932898499) ^rw932898499
- In other words, to understand how technology increases efficiency, we need to be able to differentiate between the types of technologies that successfully reduce production costs and those that don’t. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/932898557) ^rw932898557
- To state the problem with the new-technology-improvesefficiency explanation more generally, the creation of some new technological capability tells us nothing about whether that capability can be achieved cheaply. Saying technology is responsible for production efficiency simply restates the question in a different way rather than answering it. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/932899117) ^rw932899117
