It uses these to create a superior customer and user experience that won’t be compromised by defects or system failures that impact business performance. Digital immune systems interlink practices from the areas of observability (see Innovation Insight for Observability), software testing, chaos engineering (see Innovation Insight for Chaos Engineering), site reliability engineering (see Quick Answer: What Is Site Reliability Engineering?) and supply chain security of applications (see Innovation Insight for SBOMs).
