## Highlights
- In Fredric Brown’s 1954 short story, “Answer,” all of the computers across the 96 billion planets in the universe were connected into one super machine. It was then asked, “Is there a God?” to which it answered, “Yes, now there is a God.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/669162692) ^rw669162692
- “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” that would become historic for AI. He focused on the concept of a machine that was intelligent. But in order to do this, there had to be a way to measure it. What is intelligence—at least for a machine? [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/669163934) ^rw669163934
- Strong AI: This is when a machine truly understands what is happening. T [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/669652345) ^rw669652345
- Weak AI: With this, a machine is pattern matching and usually focused on narrow tasks. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/669652455) ^rw669652455
- The New York Times even had a write-up for Rosenblatt, extolling “The Navy revealed the embryo of an electronic computer today that it expects will be able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/669653243) ^rw669653243
- Note: Quote from NYT on their summary of the potential of the Perceptron
- Yet by the 1980s, his ideas would be revived—which would lead to a revolution in AI, primarily with the development of deep learning. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/669653311) ^rw669653311
- Note: Rosenblatt's concept of the NN came back into prominence

- Explosive Growth in Datasets: The internet has been a major factor for AI because it has allowed for the creation of massive datasets. In the next chapter, we’ll take a look at how data has transformed this technology. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/669654512) ^rw669654512
- Infrastructure: Perhaps the most consequential company for AI during the past 15 years or so has been Google. To keep up with the indexing of the Web—which was growing at a staggering rate—the company had to come up with creative approaches to build scalable systems. The result has been innovation in commodity server clusters, virtualization, and open source software. Google was also one of the early adopters of deep learning, with the launch of the “Google Brain” project in 2011. Oh, and a few years later the company hired Hinton.

- GPUs (Graphics Processing Units): This chip technology, which was pioneered by NVIDIA, was originally for high- speed graphics in games. But the architecture of GPUs would eventually be ideal for AI as well. Note that most deep learning research is done with these chips. The reason is that—with parallel processing—the speed is multiples higher than traditional CPUs. This means that computing a model may take a day or two vs. weeks or even months.

- However, this type of data accounts for about 20% of an AI project. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670140560) ^rw670140560
- The majority will instead come from unstructured data, which is information that has no predefined formatting. You’ll have to do this yourself, which can be tedious and time consuming. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670140595) ^rw670140595
- But semi-structured data represents only about 5% to 10% of all data. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670140550) ^rw670140550
- International Data Corporation (IDC) called “Data Age 2025,” the amount of data created is expected to hit a staggering 163 zettabytes by 2025.6 This is about ten times the amount in 2017. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670140674) ^rw670140674
- Big Data does have the following characteristics, which are called the three Vs [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670140779) ^rw670140779
- By far, the most common approach for unsupervised learning is clustering, which takes unlabeled data and uses algorithms to put similar items into groups. The process usually starts with guesses, and then there are iterations of the calculations to get better results. At the heart of this is finding data items that are close together, which can be accomplished with a variety of quantitative methods: [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670143179) ^rw670143179
- When you were a kid and wanted to play a new sport, chances were you did not read a manual. Instead, you observed what other people were doing and tried to figure things out. In some situations, you made mistakes and lost the ball as your teammates would show their displeasure. But in other cases, you made the right moves and scored. Through this trial-and-error process, your learning was improved based on positive and negative reinforcement. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670144390) ^rw670144390

- There is often confusion between deep learning and machine learning. And this is reasonable. Both topics are quite complex, and they do share many similarities. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/671138410) ^rw671138410
- First of all, while both usually require large amounts of data, the types are generally different. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/671138649) ^rw671138649
- But real academic progress with neural networks did not occur until the 1980s, such as with the breakthroughs with backpropagation, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. But for deep learning to have an impact on the real world, it would take the staggering growth in data, such as from the Internet, and the surge in computing power.
