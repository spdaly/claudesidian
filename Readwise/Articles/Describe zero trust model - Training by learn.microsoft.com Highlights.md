## Highlights
- To address this new world of computing, Microsoft highly recommends the Zero Trust security model, which is based on these guiding principles:
  • **Verify explicitly** - Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points.
  • **Use least privilege access** - Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection.
  • **Assume breach** - Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption. Use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/723568337) ^rw723568337
