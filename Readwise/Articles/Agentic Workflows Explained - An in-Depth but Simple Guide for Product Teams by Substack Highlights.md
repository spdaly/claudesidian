## Highlights
- An automated workflow is deterministic; unless a major variable is changed somewhere along the way, the outcome is the same each time the workflow runs. It’s predictable, stable but not dynamic or intelligent in any measurable sense. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/939482387) ^rw939482387
- An agentic workflow, on the other hand, is non-deterministic; the system produces different results each time it runs depending on each of the variable factors including the input it recipes, the tools it has access to, the decisions it makes and the errors it fixes or doesn’t fix.
