## Highlights
- Let’s start with the term “agent” itself. Right now, it’s being slapped on everything from simple scripts to sophisticated AI workflows. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/914277112) ^rw914277112
- There’s no shared definition, which leaves plenty of room for companies to market basic automation as something much more advanced. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/914277121) ^rw914277121
- That kind of “agentwashing” doesn’t just confuse customers; it invites disappointment. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/914277126) ^rw914277126
- And reliability is the next big challenge. Most of today’s agents are powered by large language models (LLMs), which generate probabilistic responses. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/914277154) ^rw914277154
- In enterprise settings, this kind of mistake could create immense damage. We need to stop treating LLMs as standalone products and start building complete systems around them—systems that account for uncertainty, monitor outputs, manage costs, and layer in guardrails for safety and accuracy. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/914277193) ^rw914277193
- That’s where Google’s A2A protocol comes in. It’s meant to be a universal language that lets agents share what they can do and divide up tasks. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/914277239) ^rw914277239
- A2A still falls short. It defines how agents talk to each other, but not what they actually mean. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/914277255) ^rw914277255
