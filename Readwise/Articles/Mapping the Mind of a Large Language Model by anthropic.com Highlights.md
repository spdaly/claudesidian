## Highlights
- *Today we report a significant advance in understanding the inner workings of AI models. We have identified how millions of concepts are represented inside Claude Sonnet, one of our deployed large language models. This is the first ever detailed look inside a modern, production-grade large language model.* *This interpretability discovery could, in future, help us make AI models safer.* [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/727122987) ^rw727122987

- Opening the black box doesn't necessarily help: the internal state of the modelâ€”what the model is "thinking" before writing its responseâ€”consists of a long list of numbers ("neuron activations") without a clear meaning. From interacting with a model like Claude, it's clear that itâ€™s able to understand and wield a wide range of conceptsâ€”but we can't discern them from looking directly at neurons. It turns out that each concept is represented across many neurons, and each neuron is involved in representing many concepts. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/727122988) ^rw727122988

- We hope that we and others can use these discoveries to make models safer. For example, it might be possible to use the techniques described here to monitor AI systems for certain dangerous behaviors (such as deceiving the user), to steer them towards desirable outcomes (debiasing), or to remove certain dangerous subject matter entirely. We might also be able to enhance other safety techniques, such as [Constitutional AI](https://www.anthropic.com/research/constitutional-ai-harmlessness-from-ai-feedback), by understanding how they shift the model towards more harmless and more honest behavior and identifying any gaps in the process.

- Note: 1. How does the approach of using dictionary learning to extract features from large language models like Claude Sonnet contribute to the interpretability and safety of AI models?
  2. What are some examples of the specific features found within Claude Sonnet, and how do they reflect the model's capabilities and potential behaviors?
  3. What implications do the findings in this document have for enhancing the safety, transparency, and ethical use of AI models, and how might these insights be applied in practice to improve model behavior and prevent harmful outcomes?
