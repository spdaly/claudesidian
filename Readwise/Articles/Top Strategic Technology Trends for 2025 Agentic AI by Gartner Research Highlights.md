## Highlights
- Agentic AI will introduce a goal-driven digital workforce that autonomously makes plans and takes actions — an extension of the workforce that doesn’t need vacations or other benefits. This research describes the opportunities and dangers of agentic AI for IT leaders, and explains how to prepare. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/808230679) ^rw808230679
- AI agency is a spectrum. At one end, traditional systems with limited agency perform specific tasks under narrowly defined conditions. At the other end, future agentic AI systems with full agency will learn from their environment, make decisions and perform tasks independently. A large gap exists between current LLM-based assistants and full-fledged AI agents (see Figure 1). This gap will close first for narrowly scoped activities. However, the scope and sophistication of agentic solutions will expand as we learn how to build, govern and trust agentic AI solutions.
