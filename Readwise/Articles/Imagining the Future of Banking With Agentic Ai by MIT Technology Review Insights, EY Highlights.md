## Highlights
- “With the maturing of agentic AI, it is becoming a lot more technologically possible for large-scale process automation that was not possible with rules-based approaches like robotic process automation before,” says Sameer Gupta, Americas financial services AI leader at EY. “That moves the needle in terms of cost, efficiency, and customer experience impact.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/934791675) ^rw934791675
- A company’s ability to adopt new technical capabilities and rearchitect how their firm operates is going to make the difference between the firms that succeed and those that get left behind,” says Buluswar. “Your people and your firm must recognize that how they go about their work is going to be meaningfully different.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/934791699) ^rw934791699
- One of the most powerful things about AI is that these systems can get more accurate over time if they are retrained on the right data with proper lifecycle management and oversight,” says Ian Glasner, group head of emerging technology, innovation, and ventures at HSBC. “The system will make mistakes, but with the right feedback loop, systems can be updated to avoid repeating the same mistakes.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/934791743) ^rw934791743
- Organizational adoption. The second most common challenge for executives in our survey is a lack of technology skills and capabilities (cited by 58% of respondents) (see Figure 6). Firms face the dual challenge of training the workforce to effectively use AI systems, which can help overcome organizational resistance to adoption, while also measuring ROI sufficiently to overcome C-suite skepticism. “How do you improve the general IQ and EQ of the organization to be able to actually adopt an AI system and not have organ rejection but rather have stickiness and usage?” asks Gupta.

- Governance, risk, and compliance. The number one challenge respondents identified in creating value from agentic AI is in managing governance, risk, and compliance with confidence (cited by 63% of respondents) (see Figure 6). As the technology rapidly evolves, regulations around the world are lagging behind. Without firm regulatory standards in place, organizations need to implement their own guardrails.

- Data integration and security. Poor data quality and integration is the third biggest challenge for banking executives in our survey (according to 54% of respondents) (see Figure 6). Large financial institutions have hundreds of existing data systems that require reliable linkages, or application programming interfaces (APIs), to execute agentic responses. Role-based access controls and security protocols are imperative, says Gupta, and can prevent a system from learning something it should not learn based on its role.

- Technological complexity. Given the rapid pace of technology change, new AI model and platform releases come out every three to six months, or even more quickly. Executives face uncertainty about future-proofing technology investments. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/934791926) ^rw934791926

- Questions around autonomy. “What sort of autonomy should you give to an agent-based system?” asks Gupta of EY. “When can it work entirely autonomously, and when does it require human intervention, or at least a human approval or review to the process?

- Building trust. Another major challenge when it comes to implementing AI in the high-stakes world of financial services is trust. In a recent EY survey, just 42% of respondents said they would trust financial services companies to manage AI in ways that align with their best interests, while 30% say they would actively distrust them to do so. The difference between those two extremes is a net trust percentage of only 12%, one of the lowest levels of the industries studied. Agentic AI seems unlikely to change this dynamic at present; just 14% of respondents in our survey say their firm expects trust to be an outcome of agentic AI (see Figure 3).
  Investing in cybersecurity is a key way to build trust. A previous MIT Technology Review Insight’s survey found that 40% of executives in regulated industries believe that effective security practices can strengthen trust in agentic AI. And cybersecurity can contribute to the bottom line too. A 2025 study by EY found that cybersecurity can add between 11% and 20%, or a median of $36 million, in value to each enterprise-wide initiative it is involved in.

- Establish a robust governance framework: “This is all about safety and making sure that our AI systems are being built in a way that we as a firm are comfortable with and within our risk tolerance,” he says. Glasner says HBSC maintains a detailed inventory of AI systems, linked to business owners, model documentation, and risk classification.
