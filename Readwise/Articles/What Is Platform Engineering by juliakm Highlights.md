## Highlights
- Platform engineering is a practice built up from DevOps principles that seeks to improve each development team’s security, compliance, costs, and time-to-business value through improved developer experiences and self-service within a secure, governed framework. It's both product-based mindset shift and a set of tools and systems to support it. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/735618152) ^rw735618152
- [Gartner expects](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/what-is-platform-engineering) around 80 percent of engineering organizations to have a team dedicated to platform engineering by 2026. These teams focus on building what is called an internal developer platform. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/735618171) ^rw735618171
