## Highlights
- Prediction: Time Series Forecasting vs Regression [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/676540453) ^rw676540453
- Time series data is data that is collected or recorded sequentially over time. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/676540820) ^rw676540820
- By leveraging the temporal order of the data, time series forecasting methods can capture and analyze trends, seasonality, and other recurring patterns to make informed predictions about future developments. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/676540849) ^rw676540849
- imple Moving Average (SMA) [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/676540977) ^rw676540977
- The benefit of SMA is that it creates a simple and intuitive predictive model, making it accessible for quick estimations and general trend observations. However, the tradeoffs of SMA are notable. SMA tends to smooth out extreme fluctuations, making it less responsive to sudden changes or outliers in the data. Additionally, it may lag behind abrupt shifts in the underlying pattern of the time series. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/676541037) ^rw676541037
- Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which assigns different weights to recent data points, giving more importance to the most recent observations. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/676541088) ^rw676541088
- Autoregressive integrated moving average ([ARIMA](https://otexts.com/fpp3/arima.html)) is another popular strategy that works particularly well on time series data that has seasonality trends. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/676541096) ^rw676541096
- Regression analysis
  Regression analysis also relies on historical data, but it differs in its approach and objectives. In this method, the emphasis is on establishing a mathematical relationship between the input variables and the corresponding output variable. Unlike time series forecasting, where the primary goal is to predict future values based on temporal patterns, supervised regression aims to understand and quantify the relationships between variables. Through the training of a regression model on historical data, the algorithm learns to generalize and predict outcomes for new, unseen data points.
