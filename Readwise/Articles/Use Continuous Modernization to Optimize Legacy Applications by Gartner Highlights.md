## Highlights
- Legacy applications often impede continuous delivery of value, but rip-and-replace efforts are costly, risky and time-consuming. Applications and software engineering leaders should instead use continuous modernization to minimize the cost, risk and impact of legacy-application optimization [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/457622718) ^rw457622718
- Use continuous modernization as an alternative to rip-and-replace programs by focusing on specific business obstacles caused by the legacy application (instead of treating legacy applications as a problem to eliminate). [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/457622810) ^rw457622810
- However, legacy applications and their ecosystems are not designed to support continuous delivery. These aging applications create friction points that negatively impact agility and velocity. To address this challenge, applications and software engineering leaders often pursue rip-and-replace efforts. However, this approach can be costly, risky and time-consuming. Furthermore, legacy applications contain data and functions that are essential for digital initiatives. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/457623375) ^rw457623375
- How can you minimize the cost, risk and impact of modernizing legacy applications and enable continuous delivery? Instead of rip-and-replace efforts, applications and software engineering leaders should use a continuous modernization approach. Rather than viewing legacy applications as a problem, you should manage the legacy application portfolio as an asset, and use it as a springboard to support desired business capabilities. Your teams should iteratively identify, prioritize and remove obstacles that impede continuous delivery of value (see Figure 1). This approach allows legacy systems to become more composable by replacing a component with more appropriate technology or by encapsulating, reusing and extending a current function.

- That being said, these obstacles do not always require you to discard legacy applications entirely. In many cases, the 80/20 rule holds true — 20% of the functions and features of an old application are causing 80% of the pain; and thus, 80% of the application is still fit for purpose.

- Continuous modernization is an iterative approach for identifying, prioritizing and removing obstacles to digital business from legacy applications. These obstacles — or friction points — are points at which the technology platform and development ecosystem are not able to provide satisfactory support for a business capability or keep up with demand. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/457624288) ^rw457624288
- Continuous modernization is a multistep process, split out across three key stages.
  **Assess and prioritize**
  • **Step 1 —** Identify the business capabilities that are supported by the legacy application. Assess how business capabilities contribute to business value streams and customer value. Use value-stream mapping or business-capability-impact mapping to highlight the impact of change or opportunities for optimization.
  • **Step 2 —** Identify which components or parts or the legacy application are supporting each business capability.
  • **Step 3 —** Assess the support for each business capability and identify any modernization drivers, such as poor business fit, value or agility, or high complexity, risk or cost. This assessment can be performed using Gartner’s fitness and value review process (see [How to Assess the Fitness of Your Application Portfolio](javascript:void(0);)). In this case, however, we are assessing support for each business capability and not the whole of the application.
  • **Step 4 —** Identify and prioritize the friction points with TIME analysis (see [Using TIME for Application and Product Portfolio Triage: Data From the Field](javascript:void(0);)). Discuss these friction points with business stakeholders to create a backlog of modernization activities.
  **Transform**
  • **Step 5 —** For each selected modernization activity, analyze the cause behind the problem and select the appropriate modernization approach to remove the friction point. These approaches include encapsulating, replatforming, refactoring or replacing application components.
  • **Step 6 —** Execute the modernization to remove the friction points or obstacles and improve business support.
  **Refine and repeat**
  • **Step 7 —** Reevaluate the backlog to include any new or changed priorities.
  • **Step 8 —** Select the next activity from the backlog and go back to Step 5. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/459096574) ^rw459096574
- Composability is a design approach that enables systems (for example, IT systems, organizations and products) to adapt quickly to changes while staying resilient. At the heart of composability is modularity. Basic elements are partitioned into a system of building blocks that can easily be configured into a solution. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/457624385) ^rw457624385
- Continuous modernization gradually enables legacy systems to become more composable by replacing a component with more appropriate technology or by encapsulating, reusing and extending a current function. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/457624423) ^rw457624423
- • Focus on modernizing parts of the application that are the root cause of a friction point to improve business support.
  • Create services and add APIs to make particular functions and data accessible.
  • Replace parts of the application or extend it with new functionality using more appropriate technology. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/459097586) ^rw459097586
- The work of modernization will fall on different teams in different circumstances. In some cases, a platform team will inherit and absorb legacy components as part of their transactional platform. Platform teams maintain and enhance these platforms to provide timely support for the product teams. The modernization of these components should be managed by the same group responsible for the platform. A portion of every release cycle should be allocated to modernization or refactoring.
