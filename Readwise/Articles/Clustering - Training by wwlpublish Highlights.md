## Highlights
- *Clustering* is a form of unsupervised machine learning in which observations are grouped into clusters based on similarities in their data values, or features. This kind of machine learning is considered unsupervised because it doesn't make use of previously known label values to train a model. In a clustering model, the label is the cluster to which the observation is assigned, based only on its features. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729658289) ^rw729658289
