- Why is IBM suing Micro Focus? [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/576239783) ^rw576239783
- While IBM CICS services require the use of IBM mainframe machines, the Micro Focus solution allows users to use generic hardware, such as clustered Windows and Linux machines, via cloud interfaces. This eliminates the need for access to large, expensive mainframes, which often require dedicated support from IBM. Furthermore, the Micro Focus Enterprise Server solution allows users to directly transfer IBMÂ [mainframe applications without needing to make any changes](https://www.electropages.com/blog/2022/04/ibm-announces-new-z16-mainframe-using-telum-processor).

- Now, IBM is not happy with this at all and fully believes that Micro Focus has reversed engineered proprietary systems to create their competitor product. Further evidence against Micro Focus comes from the fact that Micro Focus entered into contracts with IBM to gain access to developer tools (which would allow for reverse engineering) and that examination of Web Service Binding Files (WSBIND) provided by Micro Focus was mostly identical to those developed by IBM.
