## Highlights
- BERTopic demonstrated superior coherence compared to NMF, though slightly, but consistently outperformed NMF and LDA according to human and LLM evaluations. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/819076834) ^rw819076834
- Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine-learning process often used to group documents in a corpus into themes discernible from the corpus [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/819076850) ^rw819076850
- Topic modeling has great utility, particularly as it is an unsupervised learning process with various algorithms and techniques available for this task; essentially, the process considers documents to be a mixture of topics, each topic being a probability distribution over words[3].
