## Highlights
- As you probably know if you’re a regular reader of this blog, I love debugging and I’ve learned a lot from doing it. You get to learn something new! Sometimes you get a great war story to tell! What could be more fun?
  I really think of debugging as an investment in my future knowledge – if something is breaking, it’s often because there’s something wrong in my mental model, and that’s an opportunity to learn and make sure that I know it for next time.
  Of course, not *all* bugs are adventures (that off-by-one error I was debugging today certainly did not feel like a fun adventure). But I think it’s important to (as much as you can) reflect on your bugs and see what you can learn from them. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/443050215) ^rw443050215
