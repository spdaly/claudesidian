## Highlights
- This governance system requires the involvement of senior management in establishing an accountability structure and decision-making mechanism to respond dynamically to changing challenges. Risk assessments are an excellent tool to reduce uncertainty when making decisions, but they are often misapplied when not directly connected to an overall decision-making process.

- [COBIT® 2019](https://www.isaca.org/resources/cobit) provides not only a framework of a governance system but also a knowledge repository to implement it in all types of enterprises regardless of size. The benefits of implementing a governance system using COBIT 2019 are holistic and can be used for various types of challenges faced by the enterprises; however, COVID-19 is specifically being used as a case study because it is one of the biggest challenges that all types of enterprises are facing.

- The most effective way to meet these challenges is to go beyond controls and implement a governance system. The key attributes of a governance system are dynamic decision-making mechanisms, a risk management strategy and appropriate processes and systems. This governance system can empower enterprises to meet the challenges of COVID-19 and achieve greater resilience by building robust processes that facilitate achieving enterprise objectives. Successful enterprises have demonstrated that this is a key differentiator in mitigating the various risk factors of COVID-19 by ensuring resilient operations that are built on a governance system of appropriate processes and controls.

- [COBIT®](https://www.isaca.org/resources/cobit) can be used as a business framework to implement enterprise governance of IT (EGIT) for deploying new and existing digital platforms and technologies to survive and thrive through the challenging times. Enterprises can implement a systematic approach for using COBIT 2019 components as a benchmark, customizing them as required to build an effective governance system with specific focus from a business continuity perspective. IT is valuable for enterprises to understand how to effectively use COBIT’s specific components and the knowledge repository to develop key strategies and steps for business continuity using customization.

- Based on benchmarking against COBIT 2019, the example enterprise has determined that it is critically dependent on external vendors for hosting services and remote desktop services. However, its contractual agreements do not specify a standard level of service for each of these critical areas. The enterprise has decided to review and update the terms of agreement to ensure that a minimum level of service as required for the enterprise is maintained by vendors and there are appropriate punitive clauses in case of deficiency of service.

- The enterprise can use the relevant content extracted from COBIT and customize it further by adding guidance from relevant regulations (as applicable) and other related guidance. This should then be translated and updated in specific policies and procedures, standards, and guidelines that are integrated into specific areas of enterprise documentation.
