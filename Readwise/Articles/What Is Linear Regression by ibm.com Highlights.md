## Highlights
- Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/638634239) ^rw638634239
- Youâ€™ll find that linear regression is used in everything from biological, behavioral, environmental and social sciences to business. Linear-regression models have become a proven way to scientifically and reliably predict the future. Because linear regression is a long-established statistical procedure, the properties of linear-regression models are well understood and can be trained very quickly [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/638634339) ^rw638634339
