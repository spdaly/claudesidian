## Highlights
- **monitoring** is the process of collecting and analyzing system data to track performance over time. It relies on predefined metrics to detect anomalies or potential failures. Common examples include tracking system’s CPU and memory usage and alerting when certain thresholds are breached. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/932182582) ^rw932182582
- **Observability** provides a deeper understanding of the system’s internal state based on external outputs. It allows you to diagnose and understand why something is happening, not just that something is wrong. For example, observability allows you to trace inputs and outputs through various parts of the system to spot where a bottleneck is occurring.
