## Highlights
- Process management isn’t a complicated concept. Its goal is to understand how a sequence of tasks fit together to create a specified outcome and then to make improvements. It can be applied at multiple levels—to work performed by individuals or by a small group, key activities within a department, or end-to-end processes that cross the entire organization and even company boundaries.

- Done correctly, process management is extremely effective. Better-managed processes mean higher productivity: Error rates, cycle times, and low-value work are all reduced. But it can be difficult to implement on a large scale—even with a boost from artificial intelligence. AI supports narrow tasks or subprocesses, rather than end-to-end processes, so organizations must string together multiple AI use cases to improve an entire process. Process management requires massive amounts of change management—persuading stakeholders, retraining workers, and integrating many moving parts. Moreover, it’s often at odds with traditional hierarchical management because it cuts across departments to boost efficiency. And its reputation took a hit when process reengineering became a fad that left too many failed projects and mindless layoffs in its wake in the early 1990s. No wonder it fell out of favor.

- At the same time, AI and other information technologies have also disappointed companies when it comes to generating productivity gains. Robert Solow’s 1987 comment that “you can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics” is sadly still relevant. Organizations have invested trillions of dollars in data and the technology to analyze and enhance productivity but have little to show for it. Most organizations don’t even have ROI figures beyond productivity metrics for IT projects. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/859193624) ^rw859193624
- A new approach to process thinking can help reverse this situation. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/859193626) ^rw859193626
- Indeed, new ideas about processes—including scientific management, statistical quality control, total quality management, Six Sigma, agile, and lean methodologies—have a rich history of impact. The fact that new thinking about process management keeps emerging is testimony to its importance. There’s a constant need in organizations to improve operational performance, and managing processes is a reliable way to do so. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/859193642) ^rw859193642
- Process management and technology are mutually reinforcing. New technologies help companies significantly scale up improved processes, and it’s much easier to deploy and get value from a new AI algorithm when the process it supports is well-defined and well-managed. End-to-end integrated processes also make it easier to obtain the huge quantities of high-quality data needed to train AI. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/859193758) ^rw859193758
- Good process management requires departments to adopt common data standards and share data freely across an organization, although many departments may be reluctant to do so. After all, they’ve implemented systems tailored for their specific needs, not necessarily for end-to-end effectiveness. When departments don’t coordinate their data, however, it often leads to problems. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/859193975) ^rw859193975
- Process management helps bust or at least bridge such silos. It shines a harsh light on errors and the inefficiencies they cause, motivates improvement, and provides the structure needed to systematically eliminate the causes of mistakes. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/859194031) ^rw859194031
- Organizations without a strong process orientation may have difficulty getting started. In that case it may be best to focus initially on one or two processes that are critical to performance and address the rest as the organization becomes more used to process thinking. Many companies we know start with order-to-cash (OTC) processes—which encompass all the steps from when a customer places an order to when payment is received. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/859194058) ^rw859194058
- All have made significant improvements with this narrower focus. As we mentioned earlier, this is a good way for organizations that don’t have a strong history of process management to get started. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/859194153) ^rw859194153
- Technology can help companies capture and analyze customer data and the customers’ views on the current performance of processes. Customer relationship management systems can provide insights into customer attrition, numbers of service requests, and customer profitability. Generative AI systems can analyze and summarize customers’ comments in inbound service calls, emails, and social media posts—and are getting better at it all the time.

- Process mining, which extracts process data from IT systems for modeling, analysis, and business optimization, can be enormously helpful during this step too. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/859194483) ^rw859194483
- Once those have been uncovered, the team can try “task mining,” which is offered by some technology vendors and typically focuses on improving smaller processes through automation. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/859194498) ^rw859194498
- The next step is to define and put in place the metrics you need to manage the revised process. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/859194565) ^rw859194565
- Companies should also determine what level of improvement to the existing process is needed [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/859194581) ^rw859194581
- Instead of setting arbitrarily large or small goals, companies should base targets on what is needed and what seems possible. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/859194624) ^rw859194624
- Process mining is perhaps the single most valuable tool for monitoring process performance and establishing control. It will uncover the variations that all processes exhibit. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/859194909) ^rw859194909
- Smart process-management teams stay ahead of these developments and strive to keep improving processes—even radically redesigned ones. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/859194942) ^rw859194942
- The reasons for companies to employ process management are greater and the difficulties of doing so are smaller than ever before. The virtuous cycle of better data, easier technology implementation, and productivity gains has increased the payoffs, while numerous new technologies now make the work faster and easier. And though the focus on process has fallen out of favor, those who’ve maintained it have reaped the benefits. We believe that all companies should give process management a hard look and that it’s essential for firms that are serious about AI.
