## Highlights
- • Scaling *up* is adding more resources to a single instance. Also known as *vertical scaling*.

  • Scaling *out* is adding more instances. Also known as *horizontal scaling*.

- *Scaling up* is concerned with adding more resources, such as CPU or memory, to a single instance. This instance might be a virtual machine or a PaaS service. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/723611284) ^rw723611284
- *Scaling out* is concerned with adding more instances to a service. They can be virtual machines or PaaS services. Instead of adding more capacity by making a single instance more powerful, we add capacity by increasing the total number of instances.
