- According to the recent VMware report, the adoption of Kubernetes has skyrocketed among the large enterprises with 1,000 employees or more—from 27% in 2018 to [48% in 2020](https://containerjournal.com/topics/container-ecosystems/vmware-releases-state-of-kubernetes-2020-report/). Accelerated adoption of Kubernetes and containers, especially in production environments, is also echoed by [CNCF's survey](https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CNCF_Survey_Report.pdf) where over half of respondents represented small and medium businesses.
