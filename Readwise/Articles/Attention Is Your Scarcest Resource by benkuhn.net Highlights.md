## Highlights
- Like many people, I have most of my best ideas in the shower. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/923626236) ^rw923626236
- This is sometimes annoying: I could use more than one shower’s worth of good ideas a day, but I’d rather not end up as a shrivelled yet insightful prune. Mostly, though, shower ideas are the incentive that keeps me smelling okay, so I grudgingly accept the constraint. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/923626234) ^rw923626234
- That experience of mine resonates strongly with Byrne Hobart’s [observation about focus in knowledge work](https://diff.substack.com/p/the-future-of-remote-work-is-not):
  > The output of knowledge workers is extremely skewed based on focus. The productivity tiers seem to be:
  > 
  > 1. <10% focused on the job at hand: meaningful risk of getting fired.
  > 
  > 2. 10-50% focus: “meets expectations,” gets regular raises.
  > 
  > 3. 50%+ focus: superstar, 10x engineer, destined for greatness.
  > 
  “50%+ focus” is roughly when something becomes [the top idea in your mind](http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html). It’s when you start caring enough to think about it in the shower. It’s when you start habitually asking “how could this go faster?” It’s when you get [relentlessly resourceful](http://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html). It’s around when you start [annoying your coworkers and/or significant other](https://www.benkuhn.net/impatient/), although that part is avoidable with practice.
