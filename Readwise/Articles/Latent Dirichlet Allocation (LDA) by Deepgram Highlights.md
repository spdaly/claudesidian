## Highlights
- Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic generative model that analyzes documents to discover latent topics and themes that are present across a collection of texts. LDA assumes each document contains a mixture of topics, where each topic is a probability distribution over words. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/673096229) ^rw673096229
- topic modeling, a type of statistical model designed to discover the abstract “topics” that occur in a collection of documents. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/673096306) ^rw673096306
- Dirichlet Distribution serves as its backbone, guiding the process of topic discovery. This isn’t just any random choice; the Dirichlet Distribution is particularly adept at modeling variability. It captures how topics are sprinkled across documents and how words spread within those topics. Think of it as the organizing principle, the librarian's logic to categorize books and topics.

- Text Categorization: Sifting through information can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack in the massive expanse of the digital world. LDA lends a helping hand by empowering text categorization. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/673096669) ^rw673096669
