## Highlights
- At $30 per user per month, M365 Copilot represents an 83% increase over the list price of the E3 suite. At that price, organizations expect it will provide significant value. As Figure 2 shows, only 3% of respondents currently believe that it delivers significant value. This has led to a price/value inequality situation where organizations encounter friction when contemplating an enterprise rollout of M365 Copilot. So, one of two things needs to happen to rightsize the price/value ratio: The price needs to be reduced, or far more value needs to be realized.

- As a result, Microsoft is deemphasizing its messaging around “time saved” as the most significant M365 Copilot benefit. In our survey, 97% said that users saved time using Copilot, with 46% reporting time savings of up to 14 minutes per day. While this has an ROE benefit, it may not necessarily be an ROI benefit.

- time saved does not necessarily equal business value. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/799706149) ^rw799706149
- Microsoft is elevating messaging around a customer implementation strategy called “Business Case Builder” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/799706704) ^rw799706704
- Microsoft is likely to rely more heavily on systems integrators to drive M365 Copilot sales, because of their targeted focus on business outcomes. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/799706697) ^rw799706697
- ![The 2024 Gartner Impact of GenAI in the Digital Workplace Survey found that 72% of respondents agree that users find it difficult to integrate M365 Copilot into their daily routine, and 57% agreed overall that users’ engagement declined quickly. ](https://www.gartner.com/resources/820800/820869/Figure_4_Challenges_With_M365_Copilot_Pilots_and_Deployments.png)
  Leverage Enablement Activities and Change Management to Simplify Adoption
  Because M365 Copilot is built into popular office tools and reasons over email, chats and documents, the initial expectation is that the need for enablement activities is minimal. IT, therefore, used its regular approach of offering training sessions, tips, lunch-and-learns and access to videos and other training material. This approach has worked reasonably well for applications that an employee must use to get work done, such as Teams for chatting and video conferencing.
  But Copilot 365 is different in two ways:
  1. Use is discretionary — you don’t have to use it to get work done.
  2. Generic education lacks the specific context that is needed for helping workers to weave Copilot 365 into daily activities and develop useful prompts and prompting skills.
  Consequently, the data results in Figure 5 are not surprising. Adoption is far from automatic and requires persistent effort to help employees to find value. Employee-facing change management is a persistent issue, given the constant flow of changes to existing features and the introduction of the new features expected over the next year. Since reaching general availability, M365 Copilot has had over 740 product changes and over 125 new features added. The  [Microsoft roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap) is a good place to start planning for change impact. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/799709326) ^rw799709326

- 52% of respondents say that M365 Copilot produces poor quality responses and/or hallucinations; in part, due to the difficulty in ensuring that M365 Copilot is reasoning over the best data available. This data point highlights the need for Copilot to reason over current and accurate content. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/799709686) ^rw799709686
- M365 Copilot and other GenAI products highlight the pressing need for organizations to ensure that all content goes through a methodical and auditable life cycle to ensure that GenAI can provide high quality answers when using retrieval-augmented generation. For many organizations, information management has been a low priority and can be described as technical debt or deferred maintenance.

- M365 Copilot, organizations should conduct an analysis of Microsoft SharePoint Online information governance and the resources required for remediation. Microsoft may make end-customer investment funding (up to $150,000) available to customers seeking outside assistance for such an assessment.
