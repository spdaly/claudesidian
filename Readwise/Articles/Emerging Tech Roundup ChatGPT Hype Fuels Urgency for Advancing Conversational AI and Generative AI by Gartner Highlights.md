## Highlights
- The role of all three AI techniques in conversational AI-enabled products and services will increase dramatically in the next three years, transforming the intelligent and conversational capabilities of software and advanced virtual assistants (VA).

- While OpenAI ChatGPT will not be adopted widely beyond experiments and trials with enterprises, other enterprise encompassing products, like Microsoft Azure OpenAI services or Bing will be adopted in the next 12 to 18 months. Focus on learning the tech and integrating into your offering instead. On the contrary, generative AI and foundation models will be incorporated into many software technology products in the next two years. The inclusion of generative AI capabilities into advanced VAs and software will expand from 2023. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/535002077) ^rw535002077
- Gartner expects that by 2027, foundation models will underpin 60% of NLP use cases, from fewer than 10% in 2022. While general-purpose foundation models are very expensive and time-consuming to build and usually run only in the cloud, they enable development of domain-specific models that will provide future business opportunities for tech providers.
