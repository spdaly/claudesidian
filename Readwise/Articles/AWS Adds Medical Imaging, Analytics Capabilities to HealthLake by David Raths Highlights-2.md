## Highlights
- To address these challenges, AWS is previewing Amazon HealthLake Imaging, which it describes as “a new HIPAA-eligible capability that makes it easy to store, access, and analyze medical images at petabyte scale. This new capability is designed for fast, sub-second medical image retrieval in your clinical workflows that you can access securely from anywhere (e.g., web, desktop, phone) and with high availability.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/576239769) ^rw576239769
- As a result, they estimate that HealthLake Imaging could help them reduce the total cost of medical imaging storage by up to 40 percent. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/576239770) ^rw576239770
- HealthLake Imaging uses state-of-the-art image streaming for fast, sub-second, medical image retrieval in clinical workflows by maintaining low latency and high availability anywhere (web, desktop, phone). [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/576239771) ^rw576239771
- "It helps eliminate barriers to scaling due to performance concerns arising out of DICOM's legacy protocols and the real-time interaction style of medical imaging applications." [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/576239772) ^rw576239772
