## Highlights
- Executive leaders seeking faster growth in this uncertain macroeconomic climate should:
  • Find growth opportunities by turning around conversations about macroeconomic challenges and asking how the enterprise can exploit them.
  • Encourage the executive team to seek growth as a team sport, by adopting joint goals and a shared growth agenda, and by distributing the agenda among multiple executives.
  • Review the portfolio of assets to free up more money for “faith-based” investments, especially digital initiatives, over “fact-based” and “fear-based” investments. Allocate resources to overperforming initiatives and reduce course-correcting or underperforming investments.
  • Embed antifragile practices into operations to do as well as possible in the face of known and unknown unknowns. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/487454009) ^rw487454009
