- A **graph database** is a type of database that stores data in the form of **nodes** that can be connected with **relationships**.

Those relationships allow stored data to be linked together directly and, in many cases, retrieved with one operation. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/487465185) ^rw487465185
