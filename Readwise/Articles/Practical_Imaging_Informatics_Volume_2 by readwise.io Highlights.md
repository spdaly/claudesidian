## Highlights
- DEFINITION: Modality
  A modality is a particular technology
  used to create medical images.
  Examples include CT scans and MRIs. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/468291213) ^rw468291213
- CHECKLIST: Imaging Modalities
  and Abbreviations
  Conventional radiography (X-rays) 
  Ultrasound 
  Computed tomography (CT scans) 
  Magnetic resonance 
  Nuclear medicine 
  Fluoroscopy (X-ray movies) 
  HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO: Relying on Imaging
  A medical condition that is often difficult to diagnose is pulmonary embolism
  (PE). The symptoms of PE are often nonspecific (meaning that they can be seen
  with many different diseases). They include chest pain and shortness of breath.
  This disease is due to clot lodging in the pulmonary arteries (the arteries carrying
  blood to the lungs). PE is a potentially lethal disease if not diagnosed and treated
  expeditiously. Laboratory tests are of limited use in confirming the diagnosis.
  CT, however, can show the clots lodged inside the arteries and make a precise
  diagnosis (Fig. 1.1).

- In addition to high-quality image data, it is important for the radiologist to have
  accurate clinical information related to the indication for an examination. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/468291329) ^rw468291329
- Clinical information related to the reason for the order should be automatically
  imported from the EMR to the PACS. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/468291343) ^rw468291343
- Nearly all images produced in a medical imaging department are processed to some
  extent. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/468297665) ^rw468297665
- DEFINITION: Segmentation
  The separation of an image into meaningful components. In most medical applica-
  tions, this refers to an anatomic structure (e.g., blood vessels, bone, lung) or a dis-
  ease process (e.g., a tumor). [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/468298003) ^rw468298003
- The use of AI applications will increase the processing burden of a PACS. The
  additional routing of images in and out of the system requires a proportional
  increase of processing threads to accommodate the traffic. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/480111933) ^rw480111933
