## Highlights
- The lack of idea generation and the inability to execute ideas stem primarily from executive leaders being too grounded in “business as usual” and a limitation due to an alignment of thinking with their scope of control. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/488040467) ^rw488040467
- Organizations are under pressure to constantly improve in order to grow and remain competitive. As a result, a top priority for executive leaders is to digitally transform their companies, which requires identifying new sources of revenue. Executive leaders often struggle with both idea generation and execution when it comes to rapid growth. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/488040487) ^rw488040487
- Executive leaders fail to recognize that accelerating digitalization and transformation is about making connections and driving change. Its success hinges on what is connected, the breadth of the connection and the ability to make it happen. Connecting customers’ experiences typically brings the most value.

- Executive rogues are usually driven by a greater purpose — the success of an organization’s customers and constituents — but not at the expense of dismal business results or illicit or even “gray-line” activities. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/488040804) ^rw488040804
- Executive rogues, however, are willing to challenge existing rules and hierarchy in order to capture business value, imprisoned by older, archaic rules. They also exhibit courage, often fearless in the face of criticism. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/488040819) ^rw488040819
- Executive rogues promote responsible revenue and profit generation. Executive rogue thinking is about breaking rules, policies, processes or other bureaucratic walls that prevent innovation, while still adhering to rules that guard against abuse and harm. It requires recognizing and assessing risk across a wide array of consequences and taking responsibility for risk inherent in one’s ideas and actions.
