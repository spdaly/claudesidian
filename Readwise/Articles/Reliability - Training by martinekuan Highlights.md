## Highlights
- **Recovery point objective (RPO)**: The maximum duration of acceptable data loss. RPO is measured in units of time, not volume. Examples are "30 minutes of data," "four hours of data," and so on. RPO is about limiting and recovering from data *loss*, not data *theft*. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/723611603) ^rw723611603
- **Recovery time objective (RTO)**: The maximum duration of acceptable downtime, where your specification defines "downtime". For example, if the acceptable downtime duration is eight hours if there's a disaster, then your RTO is eight hours. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/723611607) ^rw723611607
