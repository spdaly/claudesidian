## Highlights
- **Retrieval augmented generation**: The hyperscalers (and by extension vector search providers) called out RAG as a part of general AI workflows. What started off as a bandaid to try to improve prompts has essentially transformed into a whole pillar of the chain of operations in these potential products. MongoDB (and Databricks to a certain extent) had already positioned itself as providing vector search as a core business, but it seems the eyes of the providers themselves are now fixed on RAG.

- **The benefits of open source (and model gardens)**: Meta and Mistral have basically turned into the vanguards for open(ish) source models in AI.
