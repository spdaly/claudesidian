## Highlights
- Distributed tracing is a technique to monitor and observe requests as they flow through your services. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/576239750) ^rw576239750
- OpenTelemetry (an evolution of OpenTracing) is the new standard. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/576239751) ^rw576239751
- Observability inherently requires looking at the data from different views to answer additional questions for other users. In theÂ [CNCF End User Technology Radar for Observability](https://radar.cncf.io/2020-09-observability), half of the companies use five or more observability tools, and a third of them have experience with 10+ tools.

- This is why OpenTelemetry is vital for us (implement an open standard once, supported by all significant observability vendors and open source tools). It allows our users to best use the telemetry data generated by our API Gateway in their preferred tool. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/576239756) ^rw576239756
