## Highlights
- Prioritize Modernization Efforts Based on Your Readiness to Change
  Modernization efforts often drive significant change for the organization. Managing this change starts with evaluating the ability or willingness of the business owners to change, followed by the fitness of the applications to accommodate it. Then, applications and software engineering leaders must enable their teams to develop the skills required to build and sustain change. The best opportunities for modernization exist where the impact of business change intersects with the ability of the organization to create and sustain the change.
  To effectively prioritize the most valuable work in your modernization initiative:
  • Use business process analysis, and outcome and risk frameworks to capture the business changes required. The fusion team must get consensus and buy-in from business stakeholders supporting internal process change.
  • Use Gartner assessment tools and methods to assess the health of applications and prioritize the right work to be done. The fusion team must review and adapt the assessment criteria to ensure they assess all impacted processes, layers and domains.
  • Use Gartner’s layered principles of system and function type, combined with capability differentiators and rate of change to establish zones of investment. See the assessment toolkit below for detailed guidance.
  • Use Gartner’s Application business fit assessment toolkit to inventory and score the business and technical health of the applications to determine the highest value areas for investment (see [How to Assess the Fitness of Your Application Portfolio](javascript:void(0);)).
  • For targeted applications, use Gartner’s technical debt assessment toolkit to assess the accumulated technical debt and perform analysis on remediation required. Review infrastructure capabilities at this point to identify and assess technical life cycle events or debt shared with other systems (see [Address Technical Debt With Gartner’s PAID Model and Avoid Bankrupting Your Application’s Future](javascript:void(0);)).
  • Consolidate application health, technical debt and prioritization into a decision matrix to communicate the cost of delayed investment and boost the urgency to act. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/459160424) ^rw459160424
- Many modernization approaches falter at this point, failing to connect near-term technology decisions to the future sustainability of benefits. Make and communicate explicit decisions on how the near-term problem is to be solved, which business and technical patterns are to be used and which skills are needed. Balance these pragmatic decisions against the long-term cost of maintaining and extending the applications. Applications and software engineering leaders must be clear that the technology choices that enable solutions at scale are maintainable, and provide a path for future business innovation.
