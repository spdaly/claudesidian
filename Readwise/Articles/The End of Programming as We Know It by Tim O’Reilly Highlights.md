## Highlights
- It is not the end of programming. *It is the end of programming as we know it today*. That is not new. The first programmers connected physical circuits to perform each calculation. They were succeeded by programmers writing machine instructions as binary code to be input one bit at a time by flipping switches on the front of a computer.

- Eventually, interpreted languages, which are much easier to debug, became the norm. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/902309380) ^rw902309380
- Microsoft, dismissively (and wrongly) called “just a bag of drivers.” That bag of drivers, fronted by the Win32 APIs, meant that programmers no longer needed to write low-level code to control the machine. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/902309407) ^rw902309407

- *I still don’t buy it*. When there’s a breakthrough that puts advanced computing power into the hands of a far larger group of people, yes, ordinary people can do things that were once the domain of highly trained specialists. But that same breakthrough also enables new kinds of services and demand for those services. It creates new sources of deep magic that only a few understand.

- The magic that’s coming now is the most powerful yet. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/902310241) ^rw902310241
- AI will not replace programmers, but it will transform their jobs. Eventually much of what programmers do today may be as obsolete [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/902311501) ^rw902311501
