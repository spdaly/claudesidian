- Frequent experiences of flow state at work lead to higher productivity, innovation, and employee development. Similarly, studies have shown that developers who enjoy their work perform better and produce higher-quality products. Interruptions and delays—which relate to the feedback loops dimension—are important factors that hinder a developer’s ability to experience flow state.
