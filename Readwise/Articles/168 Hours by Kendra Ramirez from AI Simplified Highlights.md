## Highlights
- You know that feeling when everything just clicks? When ideas flow effortlessly, when time seems to disappear, when you're fully absorbed in meaningful work? That's flow state, and it's not an accident. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/936878620) ^rw936878620
- Flow happens when we're operating in alignment, when our values, energy, and actions are all pointing in the same direction. It happens when we stop pushing against the current and start swimming with it. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/936878622) ^rw936878622
