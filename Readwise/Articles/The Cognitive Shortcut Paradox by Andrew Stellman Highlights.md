## Highlights
- Developers early in their learning path, however, face what I call the **cognitive shortcut paradox**: they need coding experience to use AI tools well, because experience builds the judgment required to evaluate, debug, and improve AI-generated code—but leaning on AI too much in those first stages can keep them from ever gaining that experience.

- Evidence is emerging that AI chatbots can boost productivity for experienced workers but have little measurable impact on skill growth for beginners (Humlum et al. 2025). [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/944439464) ^rw944439464
- In real projects, the most valuable engineering work often involves understanding ambiguous requirements, making architectural calls when nothing is certain, and tracking down the kind of bugs that don’t have obvious fixes (Stellman and Greene 2005).
