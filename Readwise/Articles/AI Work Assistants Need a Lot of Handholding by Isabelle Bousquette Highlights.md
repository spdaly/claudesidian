## Highlights
- “That’s the very first thing we focused on,” [Kyndryl](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KD) CIO Michael Bradshaw said about cleaning up data as the organization prepared to use Copilot.

- Complicating matters is the fact that Copilot doesn’t always know where to go to find an answer to a particular question, Spataro said.

- “It has been more work than anticipated,” said Sharon Mandell, chief information officer of network tech company [Juniper Networks](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/JNPR), who is testing tools from several vendors but doesn’t feel ready to put any into production.

- But that isn’t always the case—in part because the enterprise data they are accessing isn’t always up-to-date or accurate and in part because the tools themselves are still maturing. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/739206982) ^rw739206982
- At [Eli Lilly](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/LLY), a tool gave incorrect answers to questions about expense policies, said Diogo Rau, the pharmaceutical firm’s chief information and digital officer. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/739207027) ^rw739207027
