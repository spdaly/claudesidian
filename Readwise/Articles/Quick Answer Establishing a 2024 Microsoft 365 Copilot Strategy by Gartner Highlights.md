## Highlights
- At the most essential level, an M365 pilot is trying to find out two things: does this stuff work and how will it impact employee “productivity”? It’s likely that it will take years to answer these simple questions, and it is not at all certain that the M365/digital workplace team has the knowledge and resources to adequately address them. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670623685) ^rw670623685
- Public awareness of GenAI is remarkably high for a complex technology, and business leaders routinely ask for access to M365 Copilot. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670623686) ^rw670623686
- We are taking a security- and privacy-first approach. Until we ensure Microsoft’s various Copilots can be used in a secure and controlled fashion, we will limit deployment to very specific, controlled use cases. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670623688) ^rw670623688
- We are aware of the value that Copilots may have in improving business efficiencies. We intend to carefully experiment with the technology and determine where it can have the biggest impact. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670623689) ^rw670623689
- We are aware that Copilots may change job roles and responsibilities and are sensitive to the impact on the workforce. We will have an interdisciplinary group setting organizational policy on Copilot, and we will actively communicate our policy and broadly seek feedback on that direction. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670623690) ^rw670623690
- Policy setting and experimentation will occur through the end of the year. If you’d like to be part of a Copilot interest group, you can find details and sign up here: *[include intranet link here]* [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670623691) ^rw670623691
- Align Copilot with whatever team manages M365. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670623692) ^rw670623692
- Unfortunately, there is currently no generally available way to gain insight into how workers use and experience Copilot (a Copilot Dashboard is in preview, which offers some insight into usage patterns). [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670623693) ^rw670623693
- Employee sentiment must be collected via surveys, interviews and forums. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670623695) ^rw670623695
- The most valuable data point may be the degree to which an employee protests when informed that their Copilot license will be shifted to others. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670623696) ^rw670623696
- Assess your Microsoft 365 environment before selecting pilot users for M365 Copilot. Ensure you have the right information protection and governance controls in place and have taken steps to ready the environment, including addressing overshared workspaces and content. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670623699) ^rw670623699
- Specify that participation in the pilot includes an obligation to actively use Copilot, and provide regular and thoughtful feedback on use cases, accuracy, usefulness and sentiment. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670623700) ^rw670623700
- To date, experience with M365 Copilot deployments has revealed that the product is incomplete and there is no guarantee of immediate value to all users. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/666856152) ^rw666856152
- Include AI “skeptics” and C-suite leaders expressing enthusiasm and doubt, and provide training. Start with a compendium of useful prompts for each application. Use the Microsoft Copilot Lab, a website that helps employees gain prompting proficiency. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670623705) ^rw670623705
- Establish criteria and KPIs for program success/failure based on improved value to the employee and the business. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670623706) ^rw670623706
- Think twice about allowing employees to send feedback to Microsoft on Copilot performance (thumbs up or thumbs down) because prompts and completions can be shared with Microsoft employees. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670623707) ^rw670623707
- Expose a variety of non-M365 content and data sources via Microsoft Graph connectors, which allow content to connect to the Microsoft Semantic Index for Copilot retrieval and use [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670623728) ^rw670623728
- M365 Copilot includes an entitlement to Copilot Studio, which is a low-code development tool for creating custom chatbots. It had been called Microsoft Power Virtual Agents. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670623734) ^rw670623734
- With the announcement by Microsoft on 16 January, Copilot will be available through both the Enterprise Agreement (EA) and Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) channels with no minimum quantity purchase requirement. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/670623763) ^rw670623763
