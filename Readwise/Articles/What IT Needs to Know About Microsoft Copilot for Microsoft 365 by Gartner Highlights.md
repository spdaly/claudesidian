## Highlights
- Recommendations
  Based on the analysis above, Gartner makes the following recommendations:
  • **Start simply by trying** **Microsoft Copilot** **(formerly** **Bing Chat Enterprise****) first:** Microsoft Copilot will suffice for most users, especially if they are unfamiliar with GenAI solutions. Organizations that have no information in Microsoft 365 will see responses from Microsoft 365 Copilot that are no better than those from Microsoft Copilot because they both use the Bing web search index. There is no additional cost for Microsoft Copilot for subscribers to Microsoft 365 E3 and E5, or to Microsoft 365 Business Standard and Business Premium.
  • **Temper expectations for** **M365 Copilot****:** The productivity and collaboration market is littered with solutions that worked well for consumers but had difficulty transitioning to the corporate world (enterprise social networks, blogs and wikis, for example). Furthermore, the quality of M365 Copilot’s responses will depend on the effectiveness of its searching of Microsoft 365 content — and successful enterprise search requires significant investment by customers in efforts such as content organization and metadata. Without question, GenAI solutions based on RAG and other emerging AI patterns are breakthroughs, but their value for improving general productivity has yet to be proven.
  • **Broadly pilot** **M365 Copilot** **to identify** **use cases:** Use cases for M365 Copilot are not obvious. Pilot M365 Copilot in a variety of scenarios, across departments and users of differing levels of domain expertise to find use cases in which the product shines.
  • **Avoid integrating applications into** **M365 Copilot for now****:** The integration approaches that Microsoft has announced so far demonstrate the extensibility of M365 Copilot’s architecture. Nevertheless, most companies should not plan to use these for production purposes. They are still immature and changing — for one thing, the user experience will likely change frequently over the next several months. Finally, Microsoft has not published pricing for integrations.
