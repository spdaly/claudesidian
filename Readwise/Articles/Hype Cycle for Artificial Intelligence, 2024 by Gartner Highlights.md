## Highlights
- Investment in AI has reached a new high with a focus on generative AI, which, in most cases, has yet to deliver its anticipated business value. This research helps AI leaders identify other techniques worthy of investment by profiling a wide range of AI innovations, many of which are advancing fast.

- Generative AI (GenAI) has passed the Peak of Inflated Expectations, although hype about it continues. In 2024, more value will derive from projects based on other AI techniques, either stand-alone or in combination with GenAI, that have standardized processes to aid implementation. To deliver maximum benefit, AI leaders should base future system architectures on composite AI techniques by combining approaches from innovations at all stages of the Hype Cycle.

- The two biggest movers on this yearâ€™s Hype Cycle, AI engineering and knowledge graphs, highlight the need for means of handling AI models at scale in a robust manner. AI engineering is a fundamental requirement for delivery, at scale, of enterprise AI solutions that demand new team topologies. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/738250679) ^rw738250679
- Knowledge graphs provide dependable logic and explainable reasoning, in contrast to the fallible, yet powerful, predictive capabilities of the deep-learning techniques used by GenAI. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/738250689) ^rw738250689

- Cloud AI services have regressed on the Hype Cycle since last year, due to the number of GenAI-based cloud AI services that have come to market. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/738251128) ^rw738251128
