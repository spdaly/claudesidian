## Highlights
- GitHub Copilot Agent Mode represents a major advancement in AI-assisted software development. Unlike traditional coding assistants that provide simple autocomplete-style suggestions, Agent Mode functions as an autonomous peer programmer that helps developers accomplish more with less effort. It doesnâ€™t just suggest code, it understands your entire workspace, processes tasks dynamically, and iterates on its own output to improve solutions.

- One of the most powerful aspects of Agent Mode is its ability to analyze an entire codebase and determine relevant files and dependencies before making changes. Instead of relying solely on the immediate context of a single file, Agent Mode evaluates the broader structure of a project, ensuring that modifications are consistent and align with best practices. This deeper level of understanding makes Copilot capable of assisting with tasks that require a project-wide perspective, such as refactoring across multiple files or updating an entire application to use a new framework.
