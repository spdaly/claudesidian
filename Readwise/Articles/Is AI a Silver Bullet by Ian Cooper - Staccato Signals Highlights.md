## Highlights
- Like previous attempts to find a **silver bullet** such as 4GLs, it does not seem likely that LLMs as a software authoring tool will be succeed. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/811219857) ^rw811219857
- the cost of change makes most improvements to the cost to author irrelevant; in fact, some rapid authoring techniques make maintenance harder and increase the lifetime cost of software. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/811219936) ^rw811219936
- • Essential Complexity: the work involved in modelling a solution to a problem
  • Accidental Complexity: what is required to turn that model into computer code (in essence writing code) [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/811322902) ^rw811322902
- he essential complexity of a problem is irreducible: [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/811323317) ^rw811323317
- Time of task = ∑i (Frequency)i x (Time)i [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/811323254) ^rw811323254
