## Highlights
- This is reminiscent of W. Edwards Deming’s discussion on truly understanding the needs of customers and also Russell Ackoff’s ideas on seeking solutions by looking at the larger containing system. Often innovative solutions can be found if you expand the scope of what you see as the system. By expanding the scope of your vision from your product (a house) to the larger system, you can learn that the customer’s objections are not their primary objections. It isn’t concern about the new house, or the allure of competitor’s offerings, that stops people from buying a house from you, but worries about all the hassles involved with moving.

- Throughout this book we will refer to jobs in shorthand simplistic terms for ease of reference – but it’s important to emphasize that a well-defined job is multilayered and complex. And that is actually a good thing. Why? Because it means that perfectly satisfying someone’s job likely requires not just creating a product, but engineering and delivering a whole set of experiences that address the many dimensions of the job and integrating those experiences into the company’s processes. When you’ve done that well, it’s almost impossible for competitors to copy. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/881606625) ^rw881606625
