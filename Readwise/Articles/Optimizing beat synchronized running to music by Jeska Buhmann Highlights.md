## Highlights
- The tempo of running is expressed in steps per minute (SPM), i.e. cadence, and for music it is expressed in beats per minute (BPM). The tempo of running, or cadence, refers to the frequency of steps, whereas speed (expressed in km/h) refers to the total distance travelled in a certain amount of time. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729232955) ^rw729232955
- However, such an approach disregards the fact that the comfort tempo of an individual might be different at the time of the test, or that it might fluctuate during the test period. As a result, the contrast between the tempo of the music and the tempo of the exercise performance is likely to become too considerable to enable spontaneous entrainment [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729232978) ^rw729232978
- This finding highlights that conditions of entrainment yield affordances for sensorimotor adaptation to be effective, provided that the tempo of the music can be matched to the person's comfort tempo with high accuracy. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729233374) ^rw729233374
- Another aspect that is likely to be important in terms of spontaneously manipulating running cadence is the anticipation effect reported in sensorimotor synchronization studies [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729239059) ^rw729239059
- music-to-movement alignment strategies [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729232745) ^rw729232745
- Tempo-matching alone, however, does not consider the exact matching of the musical beats to the footfall instants; hence it neglects the phase (or the time between musical beat and footfall) while it maintains the period (for the musical beat and footfall, independently). In the adaptive tempo conditions, participants were still able to change their timing with respect to the beats as it takes several steps to determine the runners’ cadence. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729232736) ^rw729232736
- alignment of the music tempo of the runner's cadence using relative phase angle manipulation. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729232802) ^rw729232802
- the difference in timing between a beat and the nearest footfall can be expressed with a relative phase angle (-180° to +180°), where a 0° angle indicates that the beat and footfall instant coincide exactly. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729233725) ^rw729233725
- Alignment strategies that employ such phase manipulation minimize the relative phase angle between the beat and footfall instant, and therefore, they drive the alignment to any desired relative phase angle. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729233733) ^rw729233733
- Continuous tempo adaptation [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729233762) ^rw729233762
- Note: This is the approach that Pacesetter was using
- eveals whether footfall instants occur before the beat is played (negative phase) or after (positive phase). [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729236981) ^rw729236981
- The goal of the present study is whether we maximize the synchronization of perceived musical beat and footfall during running, and whether this maximum synchronization influences kinematics and motivation. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729237431) ^rw729237431
- The combined results of the initial and the follow-up experiment indicate that strategy S1, S2, and S3 have no significant effect on cadence when compared to the allochronic music strategy (S0). [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729237490) ^rw729237490
- The decrease in cadence observed in S4 and S5 at -70º could be explained by the fact that the beats were continuously perceived approximately 70 ms after the moment of the footfall. The participant was therefore constantly urged to lengthen the duration of his or her next step to reach the preferred -20° attractor. We theorize that, in order to deal with the perceived sensorimotor error, the brain continuously adapts in order to try to minimize the perceived sensorimotor error (i.e., obtain NMA). Although that error persists (due to our matching algorithm), the entrainment (or brain-driven sensorimotor error minimization) persists as well, and the outcome is a decrease in cadence. Conversely, the introduction of the beat prior to the footfall instant (positive relative phase angle) might rather induce a feeling of 'being late', which could in turn stimulate the runner to speed up. This was indeed observed in the follow-up experiment, where S5 at +30° resulted in an increase in cadence compared to S0. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729238585) ^rw729238585
- In the initial experiment, as well as in the follow-up experiment, similar results were obtained when comparing the enjoyment ratings of the different strategies to S0. The strategies that did not significantly affect running cadence (S1, S2, S3, S4 [0°], and S5 [0°]) were not rated differently from S0. However, in the two conditions that affected cadence most (S5 [-70°] and S5 [+30°]) a small but significantly higher enjoyment rate, or a tendency towards such an effect, was observed.

- When challenged at a level that the gamer perceives as pleasant, he or she is more likely to have a positive experience. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729237639) ^rw729237639
- it could be suggested that a small deviation from a preferred cadence, such as realized by continuously manipulating the relative phase angle to a non-preferred phase angle (S5–70° and +30°), might imply a more challenging or rewarding running exercise. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729238618) ^rw729238618
- According to Fritz et al. [[41](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6283599/`#`pone.0208702.ref041)] moving in synchrony with music can evoke a sense of agency, or a feeling of 'being in control'. Combined with a certain amount of physical exertion, this sense of agency might contribute to a perceived positivity bias [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729238641) ^rw729238641
- Music-to-movement alignment strategies make it possible for everyone to keep running in synchrony with a musical stimulus, without consciously manipulating your own behavior to align with the music. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729238657) ^rw729238657
- Our study shows that strategies implementing a continuous relative phase alignment achieve the highest level of synchronization (as intended) and are therefore perfectly capable of spontaneously manipulating running behavior. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729238660) ^rw729238660
- A change in cadence is in fact induced by deviating the relative phase angle continuously from a preferred phase angle that is typically slightly negative: a more negative phase angle (step before beat) causes a slow-down in cadence and a positive phase angle (step after beat) leads to an increase in cadence. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729238749) ^rw729238749
- The general preference for the footfalls to occur prior to the beats suggests that future music alignment strategies could be improved by considering the negative mean asynchrony (NMA) rather than 0° as a reference point. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729238827) ^rw729238827
- Music-to-movement alignment strategies enable us to continuously and closely follow a person's behavioral response to music. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729238837) ^rw729238837
- This is of great value for sports and rehabilitation programs where music-based biofeedback is employed to improve individual performance [[43](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6283599/`#`pone.0208702.ref043)]. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/729238841) ^rw729238841
- In the future, the aim is to further improve our alignment strategies and introduce musical beats either slightly before or after the predicted footfalls. Such strategies could open up possibilities to spontaneously (and imperceptibly) optimize cadence and step size [[44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6283599/`#`pone.0208702.ref044)].
