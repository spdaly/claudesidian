## Highlights
- The principle I’ve found most effective for managing these risks is borrowed from another domain entirely: **trust but verify**. While the phrase has been used in everything from international relations to systems administration, it perfectly captures the relationship we need with AI-generated code. We trust the AI enough to use its output as a starting point, but we verify everything before we commit it. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/941126862) ^rw941126862
- *Trust but verify* is the cornerstone of an effective approach: trust the AI for a starting point but verify that the design supports change, testability, and clarity. That means applying the same critical review patterns you’d use for any code: checking assumptions, understanding what the code is really doing, and making sure it fits your design and standards.
