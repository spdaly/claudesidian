## Highlights
- Estimates are **informed predictions** or assessments about a project, a feature, or a task. Let me reiterate: predictions. Very rarely will an estimate be 100% accurate, and it's crucial that all teams working together (stakeholders included) are aligned on this principle.

- • 🤝 **Lack of collaboration**: often, teams work in silos instead of collaborating to achieve a common objective.
  • 🧠 **Lack of knowledge**: there's often a lack of mutual understanding in each other's fields.
  • 🌐 **More teams involved**: it's already challenging to estimate projects when your team is the only one involved; imagine the complexity when external teams join the party.
  • 🎯 **Estimations are just guesses**: estimating projects is a time-consuming process, and even when all factors are known, they are, at best, educated guesses. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/668901888) ^rw668901888
- • **⏳ No Deadlines**: estimates should never be confused with deadlines. They are informed predictions that become more precise with increased time investment.
  • **🔄 Update Your Estimates**: building on the first principle, don't hesitate to continuously update your estimates. Again, they are not rigid deadlines; they are there to guide teams towards successful project completion.
  • **🔍 Split Projects/Features into Smaller Chunks**: this approach makes projects and features more manageable and enhances the accuracy of estimates. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/668901937) ^rw668901937
