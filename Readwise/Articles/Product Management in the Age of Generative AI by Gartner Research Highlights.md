## Highlights
- Product Management in the Age of Generative AI [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/942959355) ^rw942959355
- Generative AI technologies will rapidly reach the Plateau of Productivity, impacting how product teams work. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/942950220) ^rw942950220
- Increase productivity by mandating that product teams adopt tools and tooling that use GenAI technology to automate mundane and repetitive tasks that are both low-effort and low-creativity. Examples of these activities include meeting summarization, collation of data from disparate data sources, and brainstorming or idea generation.

- Prioritize the expansion of GenAI technology into areas that are low-effort and high-creativity or high-effort and low-creativity to optimize product team time, thereby achieving more with less effort. Low-effort, high-creativity tasks might include user interface (UI) or user experience (UX) prototyping or drafting user stories and acceptance criteria. High-effort, low-creativity tasks might include user feedback reviews or feature request analysis. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/942952089) ^rw942952089
- By 2028, 75% of product teams will be automating low-effort, low-creativity tasks using generative AI tools and technology, up from approximately 20% in 2025. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/942952095) ^rw942952095
- Work that is low in both effort and creativity provides the greatest opportunity for replacement by GenAI, while work that is high in either effort or creativity stands to benefit from AI augmentation. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/942952118) ^rw942952118
- Examples of low-effort, high-creativity work include creating wireframes or mockups, or drafting epics, themes and user stories. This work requires a high amount of creative thinking due to the nature of the work, but is relatively low-effort when compared to other tasks that product teams might perform. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/942958802) ^rw942958802
- The real power of GenAI lies in its ability to analyze, summarize and create insights based on data across multiple data sources. While individual engines running on individual datasets can provide value, the ROI is vastly multiplied when combined with data aggregation and collation.
