## Highlights
- Product launch is a continuous cycle of product-leader-led collaboration (product management and product marketing) powered by currents of updated differentiation and value propositions. Go-to-market (GTM) and launch processes remain a methodical and structured set of activities. Launch activities require testing and validation, and ultimately feed lessons back into strategy as inputs such as the voice of the customer (VoC), market feedback, new market opportunities and competitive intelligence.

- Customer success stories and case studies are considered one of the most important methods for communicating product value; however, they are also considered one of the most difficult to create. Other methods that communicate product value include demonstrations, proofs of concept (POCs), trial programs (including free trials and freemium), and sales enablement and marketing content. As a product leader, you should prioritize content creation on the content used most by buyers to make purchase decisions. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/688966235) ^rw688966235
- Product leaders must take full advantage of their product marketing teams to rebalance campaigns to lean on increased virtual events and informed channel sales teams. Strategic content marketing programs weighted toward self-service content should drive awareness and demand generation, plus increase customer adoption and growth. As a product leader, you should support and coach willing and influential product advocates. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/688965634) ^rw688965634
