## Highlights
- From 2023, investment in generative AI (GenAI) will impact IT spending on consulting by increasing the demand for key segments — namely business operations, marketing and customer management, and enterprise strategy and governance. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/644168912) ^rw644168912
- **AI services** are defined as the application of business and technical expertise to enable enterprises to create, access, manage, optimize, and govern advanced analysis and logic-based techniques to interpret events, make decisions, and enable business outcomes and experiences. These services are delivered via an external service provider and may include strategy, data engineering, model development and testing, operations, and governance across a wide variety of AI technologies, including both symbolic and machine learning constructs. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/738159306) ^rw738159306
- Service providers have been pressured to find the “white space,” high-growth opportunities for investment and sales campaigns to try to achieve similar growth rates to the past two years. Enter GenAI, with its hype and pressure on business leaders and CIOs to take action. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/738159423) ^rw738159423
- In 2023, service providers are already working with clients on exploring generative AI use cases and developing proofs of value. Service providers are also developing their own GenAI solutions and testing in their own environments. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/738159475) ^rw738159475
- This pause and pivot is manifesting in more careful consideration about how to use AI in general — and generative AI specifically — rather than full-scale spend and adoption, particularly of AI services. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/738159505) ^rw738159505
- By 2027, attacks leveraging GenAI will cause 35% of new application management services contracts to feature governance and security to handle an increase in alerts, thus requiring more — not less — human response. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/644169096) ^rw644169096
- rom 2024, the emergence of practical, industry-specific use cases for generative AI will increase demand for services aimed at helping buyers increase their agility and operational efficiency at scale. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/644169123) ^rw644169123
- Service providers must demonstrate they can work with their clients to ensure AI takes actions — rather than simply prompting or automating — to go beyond incremental value for clients and thus truly expand the services market opportunity.

- From 2024, established use cases and best practices leveraging GenAI will include code generation and autocompletion (including natural language processing [NLP] interfaces, code review and documentation, test case generation, security testing, and version control/collaboration. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/644169347) ^rw644169347
- Efficiency > productivity > improvement > transformation. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/644169912) ^rw644169912
