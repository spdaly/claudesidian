## Highlights
- In 2028, the market for artificial intelligence services will reach $609 billion with a five-year CAGR of 21.4% in constant U.S. dollars. Growth will be driven both by new generative AI capabilities and traditional AI technologies using predictive analytics and decision making. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/798667133) ^rw798667133
- GenAI skills are in high demand. In particular, expertise in prompt engineering, model tuning and natural language processing (NLP) are highly sought after. An overall tight market for talent is resulting in a premium price for GenAI skills. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/798667200) ^rw798667200
- New implementations of classic AI and GenAI projects are generally shorter and smaller with specific ROI-focused business outcomes than non-AI projects. Though this can drive less revenue generation during the primary project phase, frequent, iterative engagements for refinement and optimization will drive ongoing recurring revenue in the form of managed services.

- Gartner has made several notable changes to this iteration of the forecast. We have reduced the forecast for GenAI spending to reflect smaller project sizes and a slower progression from pilot to production than previously projected. We have aligned this update with the most current service forecast and segmentation [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/798667247) ^rw798667247
- Although artificial intelligence has been adopted broadly, generative AI remains relatively nascent in organizations. However, hype as well as justified excitement about GenAI is driving increased spending by organizations on external services seeking to understand and exploit its potential.
