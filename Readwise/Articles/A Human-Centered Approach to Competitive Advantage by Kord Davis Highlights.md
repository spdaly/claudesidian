## Highlights
- In the modern enterprise, information is the new capital. While companies pour resources into artificial intelligence, many discover that technology, standing alone, delivers only expense, not transformation. The true engine of change lies not in the algorithm but in the hands and minds of the people who use it. The greatest asset an organization possesses is the diverse, domain-specific expertise held within its human teams. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/949674450) ^rw949674450
- The problem is not the technology. It’s a failure to apply human intelligence, experience, and expertise. The AI model, built by a team of data scientists, was designed to optimize for cost per unit and speed of delivery. It did not, and could not, account for the deep insights held by the people who actually run the business. The marketing team understands that a sudden social media trend will create a surge in demand for a specific item, while the sales team knows that a key corporate client has just placed a large, unannounced order. The operations manager on the warehouse floor can predict which logistical choke points will delay a shipment, regardless of the model’s prediction. The AI’s diagnosis was based on limited data; the humans had the full picture. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/949674472) ^rw949674472

- These individuals—the marketing leader, the sales professional, the operations manager—hold the domain expertise that unlocks the AI’s full potential. The purpose of the AI is to augment and amplify this expertise, not to replace it. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/949674587) ^rw949674587
