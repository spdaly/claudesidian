- • **Globalization (G11N):** Encapsulates all of the processes of going global, meaning internationalization, localization, and translation. Furthermore, don’t forget legal and company-related preparations.
  • **Internationalization (i18n):** In terms of software, it’s all about preparing your app and/or website for localization. At the end of the day, you have to make sure that you can localize without breaking anything.
  • **Localization (L10n):** After internationalization is completed, you are ready to start localizing your content, meaning that you’ll have to make it more appealing for a locale.
  • **Translation (T9N):** Translation is one of the most essential steps of localization. It’s all about expressing a word or sentence from one language to another, preferably while maintaining as much of the original meaning as possible.
