- A November 2023 Gartner webinar poll asked respondents, “What do you think is the biggest risk/issue with deploying M365 Copilot?” Oversharing and exposing sensitive information to employees was the top identified risk. This corroborates other Gartner research that indicates that despite potential benefits, M365 Copilot can increase information risks. Copilot is only as good as the data in Microsoft 365.
