- Critical Capability of DevOps Toolchain
  The critical Capability of DevOps Toolchain that Gartner Defined as below: 
  • **Planning tools**, which are used to manage the requirements for product, metrics gleaned from production, ongoing change requirements, developer effort, time to production and product life cycle management, like Jira or Confluence.
  • **Create tool,** the activities associated with the creation of the release candidate, which includes design and code, build, and configure, (i.e., Gitlab, Atlassian, Maven).
  • **Verify tool,** the critical activities for verifying are automatic test, static analysis, acceptance testing and security, and the tools for such areas are likely CAST, SonarCode, Selenium and JUnit.
  • **Preproduction** is the key stage for the product to be deployed to the production or ready for release. The integration testing, penetration testing and stress testing will be conducted to ensure the quality and safety for the product.
  • **Release,** schedule, orchestration, provision and deploy code to production are the key activities for release, which aims to ensure the target environment is ready for release. The typical tool for it is like Jenkins or Chef.
  • **Configure** is an integral activity throughout the DevOps toolchain. It will be conducted to support IT infrastructure provisioning and configuration activities required that cannot be configured during “Create” and “Verify.” Here, we are also involving configuration for the shared server platform, storage, databases and network. The example for configuration tools are Ansible, puppet, etc.
  • **Monitor,** DevOps monitoring factors in any testing or benchmark performance metrics to measure the effectiveness of ongoing releases. Relevant monitoring information is factored back into “plan,” with any required changes added to the next release cycle, like APM, ITOM, NPM, etc. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/566668162) ^rw566668162
