## Highlights
- Analyst firm Gartner released a new report today forecasting that global gen AI spending will hit $644 billion in 2025. That figure represents a 76.4% year-over-year increase over gen AI spending in 2024. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/872382135) ^rw872382135
- Services will total $27.8 billion (162.6% growth) [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/872382276) ^rw872382276
- Gartner’s report highlights a sobering reality: many internal gen AI proof-of-concept (PoC) projects have failed to deliver expected results. This has created what Lovelock calls a “paradox” where expectations are declining despite massive investment. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/872382286) ^rw872382286
- “Corporations with more experience with AI had higher success rates with gen AI, while enterprises with less experience suffered higher failure rates,” Lovelock explained. “However, most enterprises failed for one or more of the top three reasons: Their data was of insufficient size or quality, their people were unable to use the new technology or change to use the new process or the new gen AI would not have a sufficient ROI.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/872382295) ^rw872382295

- These insights reveal that gen AI’s primary challenges aren’t technical limitations but organizational readiness factors:
  1. **Data inadequacy**: Many organizations lack sufficient high-quality data to train or implement gen AI systems effectively.
  2. **Change resistance**: Users struggle to adopt new tools or adapt workflows to incorporate AI capabilities.
  3. **ROI shortfalls**: Projects fail to deliver measurable business value that justifies their implementation costs. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/872382300) ^rw872382300
