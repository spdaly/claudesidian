## Highlights
- ![1*ulnsAJdpvet9EW4bKMK-Rw](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*ulnsAJdpvet9EW4bKMK-Rw.png) [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/471533437) ^rw471533437
- ***Fault Tolerance*** — a cluster of ten machines across two data centers is inherently more fault-tolerant than a single machine. Even if one data center catches on fire, your application would still work. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/471533445) ^rw471533445
- ***Low Latency*** — The time for a network packet to travel the world is physically bounded by the speed of light. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/471533461) ^rw471533461
- ***Decentralized*** is still ***distributed*** in the technical sense, but the whole decentralized systems is not owned by one actor. No one company can own a decentralized system, otherwise it wouldn’t be decentralized anymore. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/471533642) ^rw471533642
- This means that most systems we will go over today can be thought of as ***distributed centralized systems*** — and that is what they’re made to be. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/471533635) ^rw471533635
