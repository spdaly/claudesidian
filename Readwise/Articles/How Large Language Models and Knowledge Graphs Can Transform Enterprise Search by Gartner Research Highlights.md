## Highlights
- Traditional search engines treat content lexically. They match terms in a query with terms in a document and count how often those terms appear (this is an oversimplification, but the practice remains a foundation of lexical approaches to search).

- See also: [[research]] [[search]] 
- Vector search treats content *semantically* by using vector embeddings of both the query and the content to be searched to account for the meanings of terms and the relationships between concepts. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/758853336) ^rw758853336
- Knowledge graphs are machine-readable data structures. They represent knowledge of the physical and digital worlds, including entities (people, organizations, digital assets and so on) and the relationships between them. These entities and relationships adhere to a graph data model, which is a network of nodes (vertices) and links (edges/arcs). The entities and relationships allowed in the knowledge graph are defined in an ontology, which is a formal model of the domain being represented. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/758853999) ^rw758853999
- These models consist of numerous three-part (or in some cases four-part) statements in the form “subject, predicate, object,” such as “Person,” “hasName,” “Name.” An ontology defines which entities are allowed and how they relate to each other.

- Unfortunately, the power of knowledge graphs comes at the cost of complexity. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/758854104) ^rw758854104
