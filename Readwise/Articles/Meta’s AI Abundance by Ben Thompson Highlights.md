## Highlights
- it seems increasingly clear to me that Meta is in fact the most well-placed company to take advantage of generative AI. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/806216899) ^rw806216899
- consider the fact that I think Meta has the potential to be the most valuable company in the world [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/806216906) ^rw806216906
- All of these bets are somewhat speculative; what would be the most valuable in the short-term, at least in terms of justifying the massive ongoing capital expenditure necessary to create the largest models, is a guaranteed means to translate those costs into bottom-line benefit. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/806217192) ^rw806217192
- Meta is the best positioned to do that in the short-term, thanks to the obvious benefit of applying generative AI to advertising. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/806217209) ^rw806217209
- Generative AI puts this process on steroids: advertisers can provide Meta with broad parameters and brand guidelines, and let the black box not just test out a few pieces of creative, but an effectively unlimited amount. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/806217826) ^rw806217826
- There’s more upside for Meta, too. Google and Amazon will benefit from generative ads, but I expect the effect will be the most powerful at the top of the funnel where Meta’s advertising operates, as opposed to the bottom-of-the-funnel search ads where Amazon and Google make most of their money. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/806217906) ^rw806217906
- conversion event is initiating a chat with an advertiser, an e-commerce channel that is particularly popular in Asia. The distinguishing factor in the markets where these ads are taking off is low labor costs [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/806218634) ^rw806218634
- What is different now, though, is that the likelihood of XR mattering feels dramatically higher than it did even six months ago. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/806250194) ^rw806250194
- a world of content abundance is going to benefit the biggest content Aggregator first and foremost. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/806250228) ^rw806250228
- t’s also going to cost a lot of money, both in terms of training and inference. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/806250253) ^rw806250253
