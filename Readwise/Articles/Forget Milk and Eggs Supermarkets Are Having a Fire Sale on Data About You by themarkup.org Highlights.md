## Highlights
- Leveraging customer data this way has become a [crucial growth area](https://www.wsj.com/articles/kroger-albertsons-merger-would-create-a-big-player-in-retail-advertising-11665791359) for top supermarket chain Kroger and other retailers over the past few years, offering much higher margins than milk and eggs. And Kroger may be about to get millions of households bigger. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/480603708) ^rw480603708
- “I think the average consumer thinks of a loyalty program as a way to save a few dollars on groceries each week. They’re not thinking about how their data is going to be funneled into this huge ecosystem with analytics and targeted advertising and tracking,” said John Davisson, director of litigation at Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) in an interview with The Markup.

At a November [Senate subcommittee hearing](https://www.supermarketnews.com/online-retail/senate-hearing-highlights-consumer-privacy-concerns) about the merger, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) asked if Americans “really need a grocery store chain with wealthy owners who collect more of their personal data.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/480604487) ^rw480604487
- “The difference seems to be that a combined Kroger Albertson will be able to analyze data from approx. 85 million households post-merger rather than 60 million households pre-merger. No evidence is presented to suggest that the ability to analyze data on an additional 25 million households would materially improve capabilities to personalize experiences,” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/480604522) ^rw480604522
