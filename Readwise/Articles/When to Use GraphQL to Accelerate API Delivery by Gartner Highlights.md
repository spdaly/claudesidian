## Highlights
- GraphQL has been steadily gaining popularity among software engineers as a standard that allows consumers to use a simple query language for APIs, since its release as an open-source project from Facebook in 2015. Effective consumer control of data retrieval and extensibility to use existing data sources, services and APIs has made GraphQL a prime consideration for developers working on user experience applications and front-end development projects.

- What is GraphQL?
  GraphQL is an open specification for implementing APIs, which allows consumers to specify the content they request from a service. It provides developers with a type system to define data and a server-side engine for querying specific data elements they need. The specification also provides a query language for API consumers to define queries and mutations to update, and subscriptions to request notifications of changed data.
