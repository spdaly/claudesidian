## Highlights
- a machine learning model is a software application that encapsulates a *function* to calculate an output value based on one or more input values. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/708034573) ^rw708034573
- he process of defining that function is known as *training* [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/708034577) ^rw708034577
- predict new values in a process called *inferencing*. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/708034585) ^rw708034585
- In mathematical terms, you'll often see the features referred to using the shorthand variable name ***x***, and the label referred to as ***y***. Usually, an observation consists of multiple feature values, so ***x*** is actually a *vector* (an array with multiple values), like this: ***[x1,x2,x3,...]***.
