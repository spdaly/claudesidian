## Highlights
- This gap has inspired the development of new approaches, such as Meta’s **Large Concept Models (LCMs)** — an innovative framework designed to elevate AI’s ability to understand and reason at a conceptual level. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/837489840) ^rw837489840
- Enter Meta’s **Large Concept Models (LCMs)** — an innovative approach that seeks to enhance reasoning at a conceptual level. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/837489849) ^rw837489849
- Despite their impressive performance, these models lack explicit hierarchical reasoning — a hallmark of human intelligence. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/837489913) ^rw837489913
- Meta’s LCMs aim to process language and multimodal inputs by focusing on concepts — semantic units that encapsulate entire ideas. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/837489932) ^rw837489932
