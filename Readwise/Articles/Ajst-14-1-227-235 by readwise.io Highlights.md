## Highlights
- Knowledge Graph is a framework for representing knowledge in a structured form, capturing entities and their relationships to reflect real-world objects and their semantic associations. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/854389958) ^rw854389958
- A knowledge graph is composed of nodes and edges, where nodes represent entities, and edges denote semantic relationships between these entities. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/854389980) ^rw854389980
- This structured knowledge representation, based on triples <subject, predicate, object>, effectively supports knowledge storage, retrieval, and reasoning. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/854390029) ^rw854390029
