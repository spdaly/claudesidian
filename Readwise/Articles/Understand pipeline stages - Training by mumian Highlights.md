## Highlights
- Shifting left
  By using stages, you can verify the quality of your code before you deploy it. Using these stages is sometimes called *shifting left*.
  Consider a timeline of the activities that you perform when you write code. The timeline starts with the planning and design phases. It then moves to the building and testing phases. Finally, you deploy and support your solution. The following diagram shows these stages on a timeline.
  ![Chart with a timeline on the horizontal axis, cost on the vertical axis, and a line showing that the cost increases the later an error is identified.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/test-bicep-code-using-azure-pipelines/1-introduction?source=learn/../includes/media/shift-left.png)
  It's a well-understood rule in software development that the earlier in the process you find an error (the closer to the left side of the timeline), the easier, faster, and cheaper it is to fix. The later in the process that you catch an error, the harder it is to fix. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/936751325) ^rw936751325
