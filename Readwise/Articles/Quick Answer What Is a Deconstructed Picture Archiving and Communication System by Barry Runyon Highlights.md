- PACS Value Proposition
  Picture archiving and communication systems were developed to digitally store and transmit electronic images and clinically relevant reports, and to eliminate the need to manually file, store, retrieve, and send medical imaging films and reports. The PACS has evolved to provide access, storage, retrieval, display and interpretation of images acquired directly from medical imaging modalities (for example, X-ray, CT and MRI).
  A PACS generally consists of the following functional and architectural components:
  • Data management system
  • Image acquisition devices
  • Image display workstation
  • PACS database or archive
  • Transmission and routing network [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/566676748) ^rw566676748
