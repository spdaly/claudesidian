## Highlights
- Software development is fundamentally a practice of problem-solving, and so, as with solving a tricky crossword, most of the work is done in your head. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/942574517) ^rw942574517
- The real work usually happens alongside coding, as the developer learns the domain, narrows down requirements, maps out relevant abstractions, considers side effects, tests features incrementally, and finally squashes bugs that survived this rigorous process. It looks something like this: [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/942574567) ^rw942574567
- since LLMs can't yet hold the full context of an application in memory at once, human review, testing, and integration needs will remain. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/942574595) ^rw942574595
- As a result, for complex software, much of the time will be spent on post hoc understanding of what code the AI has written. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/942574608) ^rw942574608
- An even more dispiriting upshot of this is that, as developers, we spend an ever greater proportion of our time merely fixing up the output of these wondrous [babbling machines](https://chrisloy.dev/post/2024/12/24/llms-are-scrappy-innovators). [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/942574839) ^rw942574839
- Good tech leads expose their engineers to work at the limit of their capabilities, using processes and practices that minimise delivery risk while also enabling each team member to grow their skills, knowledge, and domain expertise. This is, in fact, the essence of good technical leadership. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/942575046) ^rw942575046
- AI coding agents are dazzlingly productive, but lack in-depth knowledge of your business, codebase, or roadmap. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/942575248) ^rw942575248
- The job of the engineer, then, is to act as a tech lead to these hotshots: to provide the structure, standards, and processes that convert raw speed into sustainable delivery. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/942575264) ^rw942575264
- By treating LLMs as **lightning-fast junior engineers**, we can lean on best practices from the software development lifecycle to build systems that scale. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/942575292) ^rw942575292
