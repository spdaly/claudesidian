## Highlights
- **"Woodshedding"**, or shedding, is a term commonly used to describe the act of practicing some endeavor, usually in private, to improve one's proficiency in performing it. It is typically used by musicians to mean rehearsing a difficult passage repeatedly, until it can be performed flawlessly.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodshedding`#`cite_note-defmusicdictionary-1) The term is used [metaphorically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor) where "the woodshed" means any private place to practice without being heard by anyone else. This is based on the assumption that an actual woodshed would likely be in a remote location, away from the main house. The term is also used in other contexts.
