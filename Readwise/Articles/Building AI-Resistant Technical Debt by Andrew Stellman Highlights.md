## Highlights
- Anyone who’s used AI to generate code has seen it make mistakes. But the real danger isn’t the occasional wrong answer; it’s in what happens when those errors pile up across a codebase. Issues that seem small at first can compound quickly, making code harder to understand, maintain, and evolve. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/936391995) ^rw936391995
- The AI generates a lot of code, and it’s not practical to review every line every time it regenerates. Trying to read it all can lead to **cognitive overload**—mental exhaustion from wading through too much code—and makes it harder to throw away code that isn’t working just because you already invested time in reading it.

- When adding or updating a unit test feels unreasonably difficult, that’s often the first sign the design is too rigid. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/936697277) ^rw936697277
- That’s where the “trust but verify” habit comes in. Trust the AI to give you a starting point, but verify that the design supports change, testability, and clarity. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/936697134) ^rw936697134
