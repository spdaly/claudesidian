## Highlights
- The survey results indicate an interest in use cases that improve clinician efficiency. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/640877556) ^rw640877556
- top six use cases are Ambient Digital Scribes, Automating Data Analysis, Clinical Message Autoreply, Automating Consumer Messaging, electronic health record (EHR) Search and Summarization and Document Auto-Generation. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/640877575) ^rw640877575
- These use cases help reduce clinicians’ time on tasks that take time away from direct patient care. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/640877583) ^rw640877583
- By 2027, clinicians will have reduced the time spent on clinical documentation tasks by 50% through the use of generative AI technologies integrated into the EHR, improving clinician and patient experience. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/640877593) ^rw640877593
- Clinicians are challenged with balancing optimal patient care with efficiently managing associated documentation and administrative responsibilities. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/640877677) ^rw640877677
- A recent study of U.S. physicians found that they spend, on average, 15.5 hours on paperwork and administrative tasks every week. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/640877695) ^rw640877695
- Another study found that physicians, nurses and allied health practitioners in England spend an average of 13.5 hours generating clinical documentation — an increase of 25% over the last seven years. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/640878328) ^rw640878328
- In addition, administrative tasks have been estimated to account for nearly 25% of U.S. healthcare spending. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/640878471) ^rw640878471
- GenAI has sparked widespread interest in, and focus on, the potential to automate and augment many of these administrative tasks to free clinician time to provide clinical care and reduce burnout. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/640878483) ^rw640878483
- Early use cases include: ambient digital scribes to automate clinical encounter documentation; drafting responses to patient messages; summarizing information in the clinical record; drafting other clinical documents, such as referral letters and patient discharge summaries; and automating clinical coding. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/640878491) ^rw640878491
- Ambient digital scribe solutions have already gained significant market traction in the U.S. While these solutions have been commercially available for some time, the evolution and increased availability of LLMs are accelerating the development and accuracy of the solutions. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/640877761) ^rw640877761
- EHR vendors have pivoted rapidly in response to the opportunity and customer interest. Some vendors are building capabilities natively. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/640877783) ^rw640877783
- Avoid getting caught up in the hype. Instead, take a strategic approach to identifying the highest value use cases for your organization by working with clinical informatics leaders to identify the greatest areas of digital friction associated with clinical documentation and administrative tasks. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/640878621) ^rw640878621
- Work with your EHR vendor to build a detailed understanding of its product development roadmap for incorporating GenAI into its solution offerings. Identify gaps aligned to your organizations’ highest value use cases that may require third-party solutions or internal development of capabilities. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/640878623) ^rw640878623
- Ensure the safe and responsible deployment of solutions by ensuring appropriate governance strategies are in place that address issues, including transparency, interpretability, ethics, bias and regulatory requirements (such as privacy and security). And build organizational readiness by providing training programs to ensure end users have the appropriate knowledge and skills to use applications in a safe and ethical manner. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/640878629) ^rw640878629
- Maximize ROI by assembling a cross-functional fusion team, including clinicians, informatics, software developers and AI experts to lead implementations with a focus on end-user experience. Deliver the minimum functionality required to test the use cases, and refine your assumptions on the cost and value of scaling them. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/640878631) ^rw640878631
