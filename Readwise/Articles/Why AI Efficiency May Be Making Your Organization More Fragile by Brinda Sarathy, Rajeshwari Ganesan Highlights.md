## Highlights
- How will AI compromise the ability of newer generations of scholars and students to think critically, to engage in nuance and debate, and to experience the *benefits* born out of human friction? [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/944440473) ^rw944440473
- Today’s AI tools excel at what managers have long considered inefficiency: the messy, time-consuming parts of knowledge work. (There are also considerable environmental and social justice concerns about AI, but we will save them for a future post). But something more concerning is happening beneath the surface.

- The most successful knowledge workers have always been those who could synthesize disparate perspectives, ask better questions, and navigate ambiguity. These capabilities develop through what we might call “productive friction”—the discomfort of reconciling conflicting viewpoints, the struggle of articulating half-formed ideas, and the hard work of building understanding from scratch and in relationship with other people. This is wisdom born out of experience, not algorithm. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/944440948) ^rw944440948
