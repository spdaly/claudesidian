## Highlights
- With so many wild predictions flying around about the future AI, it’s important to occasionally take a step back and check in on what came true — and what hasn’t come to pass. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/938686619) ^rw938686619
- Exactly [six months ago](https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-ceo-ai-90-percent-code-3-to-6-months-2025-3), Dario Amodei, the CEO of massive AI company Anthropic, claimed that in half a year, AI would be "writing 90 percent of code." And that was the worst-case scenario; in just three months, he predicted, we could hit a place where "essentially all" code is written by AI.

- Research published within the past six months explain why: AI has been found to [actually slow down software engineers](https://futurism.com/ai-coding-programmers-reality), and increase their workload. Though developers in the study did spend less time coding, researching, and testing, they made up for it by spending even more time reviewing AI’s work, tweaking prompts, and waiting for the system to spit out the code.

- Cyber security researchers recently found that developers who use AI to spew out code end up creating [ten times the number of security vulnerabilities](https://futurism.com/ai-coding-security-problems) than those who write code the old fashioned way.

- That’s causing issues at a growing number of companies, leading to [never before seen vulnerabilities](https://hackread.com/slopsquatting-threat-ai-generated-code-hallucinations/) for hackers to exploit. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/938686685) ^rw938686685
