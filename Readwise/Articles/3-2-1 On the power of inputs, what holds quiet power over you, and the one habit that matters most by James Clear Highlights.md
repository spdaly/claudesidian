- Social media consultant **Charles Miller** on balance:
  “Spend a handful of hours a day going fast. Crush a gym session. Do deep work on a project you care about. Spend the rest of the day going slow. Take walks. Read books. Get a long dinner with friends. Either way, avoid the anxious middle where you never truly relax or truly move forward.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/860579721) ^rw860579721
