## Highlights
- To paraphrase [Kratzenberg’s First Law](https://substack.com/redirect/011b53e1-cfd3-4fd2-8f21-ebc327be3e76?j=eyJ1IjoiMmc3a2xqIn0.uzdTzNmnO6ouD8B9Cxd6K3-0mXi5lgUXgnQWQGjtJkI): “AI at work is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.” AI does not automatically improve the experience of work, nor does it automatically rob us of meaning or replace workers. How leaders and employees use the technology will determine whether it is good or bad. But AI also isn’t neutral. The use of AI will inevitably lead to deep and profound changes.
