## Highlights
- “Work hard on what comes easily.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/934480441) ^rw934480441
- “Use the best idea you have right now. Claiming you need to ‘learn more' or ‘get your ducks in a row' is just a crutch that prevents you from starting. Education is a lifelong pursuit. You will always need to learn more. It's not a reason to wait.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/934480454) ^rw934480454
- “One study looked at artists who started at the bottom and worked their way to successful careers. The researchers identified one factor that was consistent across the group: they performed far more shows than the average artist.
  The same principle holds true in many fields. If you want to rise, you need a lot of shots on goal. Keep showing up. Keep making new material. Eventually, you catch a lucky break.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/934480474) ^rw934480474
- Priest and philosopher **Desiderius Erasmus** reminds us of the power of concentrating on a single target:
  “He who chases two hares catches neither.”

- “Live your life each day as you would climb a mountain. An occasional glance toward the summit keeps the goal in mind, but many beautiful scenes are to be observed from each new vantage point. Climb slowly; steadily, enjoying each passing moment; and the view from the summit will serve as a fitting climax for the journey.”
