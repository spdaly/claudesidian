## Highlights
- The modality sends the images to the PAC server, from there a viewer can be configured to query the server and retrieve images. Many PACs systems also allow Dicomweb viewing through a browser. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/467691347) ^rw467691347
- These videos are a high level overview of DICOM, SOP Classes, PACS, Viewers, etc. There are references to my website [https://pacsbootcamp.com/learn/](https://pacsbootcamp.com/learn/) where I have created guides on how to configure a new PACS device. What images someone can expect to view, etc. It's all free information. Reach out to me if you need further clarification. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/467691392) ^rw467691392
