## Highlights
- The GenAI market hype started in late 4Q22 with Microsoftâ€™s launch of ChatGPT (via the OpenAI partnership). Even early technology adopters spent 1H23 learning about the benefits, legal and data security risks, ethics, use cases, costs, technologies, and vendors. In reality, the SIs themselves were learning about GenAI, while at the same time trying to sell their value proposition to customers. Most SIs had some experience with earlier AI generations, such as conversational AI (CAI), but adoption was limited because of the amount of expensive labor required.

- Gartner understands that SI GenAI revenue for 2023 was modest, as it was a year to learn, test and trial. Early revenue is expected to begin in 2024, before accelerating in later years. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/738171741) ^rw738171741
- The Gartner Generative AI 2024 Planning Survey reveals that 79% of business executives who lead corporate functions outside IT will begin or continue to implement generative AI by the end of 2024. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/738171784) ^rw738171784

- Few SIs reported customers wanting to deploy GenAI with legacy on-premises contact centers. Customers realize they will be transitioning to CCaaS, so do not want to rip and replace their GenAI running with legacy infrastructure while they migrate to CCaaS at a later date.
