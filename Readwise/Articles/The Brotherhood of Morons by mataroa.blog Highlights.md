## Highlights
- I have a running joke with my friends that there is a secret society called The Brotherhood of Morons, a group of malicious individuals committed to the steady erosion of all intelligent decision-making. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/689440696) ^rw689440696
- The first kind reads about "stupid people" and laughs. Every waking moment of life does not actually consist of blasting swarms of dimwitted suggestions out of the sky like the world's saddest flak battery, but there's something funny about seeing the blueprint for stupid interactions acknowledged. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/689440737) ^rw689440737
- The second kind of person reads the quote above and seethes at all those *blasted idiots* that don't understand their brilliance, either because they're having a bad day and actually are surrounded by idiots, or because *they're the ones* that are difficult to get along with [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/689440754) ^rw689440754
- Then there is the third kind of person who, upon reading anything like the quote above, immediately insists that the complainant *must* secretly be the insufferable one, because actually smart people don't experience frustration for reasons unknown.

- Stupidity is surprisingly difficult to define. Any attempt to do so typically means asserting that the *inverse* of that definition is intelligence, an academic debate that will rage on long after the sun has gone cold. Or consider anyone who blunders repeatedly but nonetheless gets promoted - are they *stupid* because they weren't able to avoid blundering, or *intelligent* because it seems that they still got what they were after?

- This definition of stupidity as "an action that harms everyone" has some useful properties - namely, that it *actually describes* what I mean when I say "that person is so fucking stupid that they can't be trusted to do anything". For example, I wish Ben Shapiro would shut the fuck up, *but* I know that he would go to bat for me as long as he thought he could sell testosterone supplements as a side-effect.

- A stupid creature will harass you for no reason, for no advantage, without any plan or scheme and at the most improbable times and places. You have no rational way of telling if and when and how and why the stupid creature attacks. When confronted with a stupid individual you are completely at his mercy.

- The reason that the stupid leaders of society seem so egregious might not be because of their startling foolishness, but simply because they are stupid in exactly the same proportions as the stock from which they are elevated. Most of us are not so naive as to believe that elevation is meritocratic, but most of us expect that the filter has *some* effect on the distribution of individuals that are moved to power.

- Non-stupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid individuals. In particular non-stupid people constantly forget that at all times and places and under any circumstances to deal and/or associate with stupid people infallibly turns out to be a costly mistreake.

- Non-stupid people *always* forget the damaging power of stupid individuals. *Always*. The author is fully aware that this applies to himself. And consider this rule: [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/689440945) ^rw689440945

- I'll be making some moves to rectify this, even if it means having to spend more energy working elsewhere - the risk of a fool destroying our department's budget and putting me out of a job is too high. The easy work isn't worth it, plus I'm always worried that stupidity is contagious. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/689440947) ^rw689440947
