## Highlights
- The overwhelming majority of examples where AI agents have been integrated with workflows in a production environment and that have delivered value, are related to single, independent tasks, where the orchestration is performed by the existing, traditional workflow technology. There is a lack of production environments where AI agents are responsible for process orchestration. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/941198743) ^rw941198743
- Recommendations
  • Don’t overhaul your entire workflow with AI agents all at once. Instead, pinpoint specific tasks in your workflows that are well-suited for AI agents — those with clear inputs and outputs and measurable performance, and where these agents can clearly add business value.

- By 2027, over 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled due to escalating costs, unclear business value or inadequate risk controls. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/941150689) ^rw941150689
