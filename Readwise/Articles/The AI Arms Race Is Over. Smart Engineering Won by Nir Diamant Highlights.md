## Highlights
- For ten years, the recipe for AI breakthroughs was simple: make models bigger and train them longer. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/925421018) ^rw925421018
- But that's changing. GPT-4 was much better than GPT-3, but newer models show much smaller improvements. Other AI companies report the same pattern. Adding more parameters and data no longer creates the dramatic leaps we're used to. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/925421024) ^rw925421024 
- See also: [[large language models]] 
- Even the biggest advocates of scaling now admit we need completely new ideas to reach the next level. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/925421032) ^rw925421032
- No matter how big we make these models, they might still fail at tasks that need real reasoning or understanding. This is why many researchers think that just making the same type of AI bigger won't give us human-like intelligence. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/925421218) ^rw925421218
- To break through this barrier, we probably need completely new ways to build AI. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/925421232) ^rw925421232
- Real general intelligence likely needs abilities that current AI doesn't have, such as:
  • Learning completely new tasks by itself
  • Setting its own goals
  • Understanding the physical world like humans do [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/925421286) ^rw925421286
