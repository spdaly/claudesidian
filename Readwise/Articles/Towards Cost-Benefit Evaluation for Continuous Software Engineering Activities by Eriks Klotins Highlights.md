## Highlights
- We conclude that the benefits of CI/CD are overstated in literature without
  considering the contextual and domain complexities rendering some benefits infeasible. We
  identify the need to understand the customer and organizational perspectives further and
  understand the contextual requirements towards the CI/CD. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/540405511) ^rw540405511
- Most
  existing software engineering practices and architectures need to be adjusted to fit within
  a continuous pipeline. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/540405777) ^rw540405777
