## Highlights
- But there is also a profound belief that AI represents a threat. Philosopher Nick Bostrom is among the most prominent voices asserting that AI poses an existential risk. As he lays out in his 2014 book *Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies*, if ‚Äúwe build machine brains that surpass human brains in general intelligence . . . the fate of our species would depend on the actions of the machine super-intelligence.‚Äù [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/728733955) ^rw728733955
- What we call AI at the moment is predominantly focused on LLMs, or large language models. The models are fed massive sets of data‚ÄîChatGPT essentially hoovered up the entire public internet‚Äîand trained to find patterns in them. Units of meaning, such as words, parts of words, and characters, become tokens and are assigned numerical values. The models learn how tokens relate to other tokens and, over time, learn something like context: where a word might appear, in what order, and so on.

- Note: What is AI? At least commonly referenced since Nov 2022
- This is why, for decades, the standard test for whether technology was approaching intelligence was the Turing test, named after its creator Alan Turing, the British mathematician and Second World War code breaker. The test involves a human interrogator who poses questions to two unseen subjects‚Äîa computer and another human‚Äîvia text-based messages to determine which is the machine. A number of different people play the roles of interrogator and respondent, and if a sufficient proportion of interviewers is fooled, the machine could be said to exhibit intelligence. ChatGPT can already fool at least some people in some situations. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/728734740) ^rw728734740
- All the same, the idea of LLMs as repositories of meaning that are then recombined does align with some assertions from twentieth-century philosophy about the way humans think, experience the world, and create art. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/728736940) ^rw728736940
- It radically oversimplifies the theological issue, but theodicy, too, is in some ways a kind of logical puzzle, a pattern of ideas that can be recombined in particular ways. I don‚Äôt mean to say that AI can solve our deepest epistemological or philosophical questions, but it does suggest that the line between thinking beings and pattern recognition machines is not quite as hard and bright as we may have hoped.

- So much of what produces will and desire is located in the body, not just in the obvious sense of erotic desire but the more complex relation between an interior subjectivity, our unconscious, and how we move as a body through the world, processing information and reacting to it. Zebrowski suggests there is a case to be made that ‚Äúthe body matters for how we can think and why we think and what we think about.‚Äù She adds, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like you can just take a computer program and stick it in the head of a robot and have an embodied thing.‚Äù Computers might in fact approach what we call thinking, but they don‚Äôt dream, or want, or desire, and this matters more than AI‚Äôs proponents let on‚Äînot just for why we think but what we end up thinking. When we use our intelligence to craft solutions to economic crises or to tackle racism, we do so out of a sense of morality, of obligation to those around us, our progeny‚Äîour cultivated sense that we have a responsibility to make things better in specific, morally significant ways.

- Yet it‚Äôs also the imbrication of AI into existing systems that is cause for concern. As Damien P. Williams, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, pointed out to me, training models absorb masses of data based on what is and what has been. It‚Äôs thus hard for them to avoid existing biases, both of the past and the present. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/728733472) ^rw728733472

- As such, the threat of AI isn‚Äôt really that of a machine or system which offhandedly kills humanity. It‚Äôs the assumption that AI is in fact intelligent that causes us to outsource an array of social and political functions to computer software‚Äîit‚Äôs not just the tech itself which becomes integrated into day-to-day life but also the particular logic and ethos of tech and its libertarian-capitalist ideology.

- Everything from a tech bro placing his hopes for human advancement on a superhuman intelligence to a military relying on AI software to list targets evinces the same desire for an objective authority figure to which one can turn. When we look to artificial intelligence to make sense of the world‚Äîwhen we ask it questions about reality or history or expect it to represent the world as it is‚Äîare we not already bound up in the logic of AI? We are awash with digital detritus, with the cacophony of the present, and in response, we seek out a superhuman assistant to draw out what is true from the morass of the false and the misleading‚Äîoften to only be misled ourselves when AI gets it wrong.

- But here in the real world, perhaps meeting God isn‚Äôt the aim. It‚Äôs the torture and the ecstasy of the attempt to do so. Artificial intelligence may keep growing in scope, power, and capability, but the assumptions underlying our faith in it‚Äîthat, so to speak, it might bring us closer to God‚Äîmay only lead us further away from Him.
