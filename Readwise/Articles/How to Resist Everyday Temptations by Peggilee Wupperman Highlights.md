## Highlights
- *mpulsive behaviours* are actions focused on short-term consequences with little regard for potential long-term consequences. Impulsivity can manifest in a myriad of ways, such as overeating, overspending, aggression, misusing alcohol or drugs, excessive social media use, risky sexual behaviour, gambling and so on.

- Just as Pavlov’s dogs learned to associate a bell with food, we can learn to associate specific people, places or situations with impulsive behaviour. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/933555444) ^rw933555444

- First, take a moment to *identify* an impulsive behaviour that is currently interfering with your life. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/933560392) ^rw933560392
- Second, take some time to *think* about what you want out of life – and how your life could be different if that behaviour wasn’t getting in the way. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/933560411) ^rw933560411
- Third, think about the *negative consequences* of the impulsive behaviour. (These may largely be the opposite of the previous answers. That’s OK.) [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/933560418) ^rw933560418
- mindfulness is the ability to be aware of and attentive to your current experience, without getting caught up in emotions or rumination. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/933560449) ^rw933560449

- Mindfulness practice doesn’t mean that you’ll go into a trance or even that you’ll necessarily feel relaxed. It involves taking time to allow yourself to experience whatever you experience – without telling yourself that there’s a way you *should* or *shouldn’t* be feeling. You might find mindfulness exercises relaxing, but you can also be mindful of the fact that you’re experiencing anxiety, boredom or an urge to act impulsively.
