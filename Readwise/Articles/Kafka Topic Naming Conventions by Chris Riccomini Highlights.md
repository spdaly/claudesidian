## Highlights
- There are two types of naming conventions: structural and semantic. A good topic naming convention should define both structural and semantic guidelines. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/466549971) ^rw466549971
- <message type>.<dataset name>.<data name> [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/466554529) ^rw466554529
- The most obvious way to enforce a naming convention is to disable [auto.create.topics.enable](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/`#`brokerconfigs), and limit who can create topics. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/466554923) ^rw466554923
