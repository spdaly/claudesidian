## Highlights
- Data gravity is the idea, proposed by IT engineer Dave McCrory in 2010, that data, or activity around data, attracts and creates more data. With traditional software workloads, data gravity is strong. If you have terabytes of data stored in a particular cloud, the cost to transmit it elsewhere for processing is high. So many teams pick a cloud such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud and build on it. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/692352949) ^rw692352949
- However, for many generative AI applications, the cost of processing is much greater than the cost of transmission. This weakens data gravity because data is more weakly bound to the cloud provider or data center where it’s stored, so it’s more practical to build systems that send packets to different servers all over the internet.
