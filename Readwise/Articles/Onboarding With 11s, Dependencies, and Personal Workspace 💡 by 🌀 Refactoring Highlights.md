## Highlights
- One of the most underrated tactics to onboard yourself well in a new company is to have 1:1s with literally *everyone* who is even remotely related to your job.
  Do that in the first 30 days, and don't wait for your manager to take care of this.
  How to?
  Create a list of all the people in your team and key stakeholders in the company. Don't be afraid to reach out to the manager of your manager, and others that feel "too high". Nobody ever gets pissed off for this.
  Prepare some questions to make this both a moment of bonding and learning. Here are a few:
  â€¢ **What should I know about the product / company / people?**
  â€¢ **What is the biggest challenge that you face?**
  â€¢ **What can I do to make your life easier?**
  â€¢ **Who else should I talk to?** [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/764015622) ^rw764015622
