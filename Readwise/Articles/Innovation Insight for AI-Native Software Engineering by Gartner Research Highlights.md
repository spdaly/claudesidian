## Highlights
- SWE agents are a nascent technology, but they have reached a level of practical utility to drive growing enterprise interest and early-stage experimentation. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/938470896) ^rw938470896
- The most effective early use cases for SWE agents tend to be tightly scoped tasks with clear, measurable outcomes such as bug fixes, unit test suites, refactoring and API endpoint creation. Higher-complexity scenarios currently achieve less consistent outcomes. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/938470905) ^rw938470905
- Start SWE agent adoption with tasks where the required information is readily accessible and the agent has proven capability. Scale to more complex cases gradually, using pilots to manage expectations and build organizational confidence. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/938470954) ^rw938470954
- Evaluate SWE agents within the broader framework of AI-native software engineering. This should include people, process and workflow impacts, alongside evaluation of the technology itself. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/938470958) ^rw938470958
- By 2028, asynchronous SWE agent workflows will improve software engineering team productivity by 30% to 50%, surpassing the 0% to 20% gains from AI code assistants in 2025. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/938470976) ^rw938470976
- **Technical debt remediation â€”** SWE agents can systematically traverse codebases to identify and resolve deprecated API usage, update dependency chains and assist with modernizing legacy code patterns. Unlike traditional developer tools that work at a local project level, file-by-file, agents can maintain awareness of cross-system dependencies and can ensure consistent application of updates across related components. This capability proves especially valuable for the routine maintenance work that typically gets deprioritized in favor of feature development.
