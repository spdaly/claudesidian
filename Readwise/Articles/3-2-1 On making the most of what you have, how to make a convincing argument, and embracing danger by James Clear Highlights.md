## Highlights
- “The more control you have over your attention, the more control you have over your future. And it starts with having enough courage to protect your time.
  It’s so easy to say yes. We want to be agreeable, helpful, liked. That’s how time disappears and attention becomes fragmented: not in big chunks, but in a thousand small concessions.
  What you trade your attention for is what your life becomes.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/884775482) ^rw884775482
- “Someone will start with more money than you. Someone will get into a better school. Someone will inherit connections you need to build from scratch. Someone will get picked before you. In other words, you’ll have no problem finding people with a head start.
  That’s not the point.
  The point is: when you get your opportunity, you make the most of it.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/884775494) ^rw884775494
