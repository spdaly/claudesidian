## Highlights
- IN 2019, JUST fi ve years after the Ant Financial Services Group was launched, the number of consumers using its services passed the one billion mark. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/781286300) ^rw781286300
- But in all cases digital decision factories handle some of the most critical processes and operating decisions. Software makes up the core of the firm, while humans are moved to the edge. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/781286578) ^rw781286578
- Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella, refers to AI as the new “runtime” of the firm [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/781286318) ^rw781286318
- Four components are essential to every factory. The first is the data pipeline, the semiautomated process that gathers, cleans, integrates, and safeguards data in a systematic, sustainable, and scalable way. The second is algorithms, which generate predictions about future states or actions of the business. The third is an experimentation platform, on which hypotheses regarding new algorithms are tested to ensure that their suggestions are having the intended effect. The fourth is infrastructure, the systems that embed this process in software and connect it to internal and external users. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/781286604) ^rw781286604

- After hundreds of years of incremental improvements to the industrial model, the digital firm is now radically changing the scale, scope, and learning paradigm. AI-driven processes can be scaled up much more rapidly than traditional processes can, allow for much greater scope because they can easily be connected with other digitized businesses, and create incredibly powerful opportunities for learning and improvement—like the ability to produce ever more accurate and sophisticated customer-behavior models and then tailor services accordingly. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/781287498) ^rw781287498
- In traditional operating models, scale inevitably reaches a point at which it delivers diminishing returns. But we don’t necessarily see this with AI-driven models, in which the return on scale can continue to climb to previously unheard-of levels. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/781287549) ^rw781287549
- The concept of scale has been central in business since at least the Industrial Revolution. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/781287119) ^rw781287119
- Scale, scope, and learning have come to be considered the essential drivers of a firm’s operating performance. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/781287163) ^rw781287163
- For leaders of traditional ﬁrms, com- peting with digital rivals involves more than deploying enterprise software or even building data pipelines, under- standing algorithms, and experiment- ing. It requires rearchitecting the ﬁrm’s organization and operating model. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/806256116) ^rw806256116
- cannot happen in a skunkworks or be spearheaded by some separate autono- mous group. It requires a holistic effort. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/806256220) ^rw806256220
