## Highlights
- To pursue those paths, company leaders should first seek to understand the potential impact of generative AI on their particular industry, which could be much larger than it might now appear. Functional leaders should similarly analyze the potential impact in their domains. Then, working collaboratively with IT and technology leaders, executives throughout the organization can get down to the hard work of reinventing jobs, reconstituting processes, and refocusing the organization’s talent and reskilling strategies to realize the full potential of generative AI.

- We found that 44% of all working hours across industries have the potential to be impacted by generative AI. The largest opportunity lies in banking, where 72% of working hours can potentially be transformed by generative AI. In insurance, the figure is 68%. In capital markets, it’s 67%. For industries in the middle of the pack, like retail, travel, health, and energy, the number of working hours that generative AI could potentially transform ranged from 40% to nearly 50%. In a similar analysis across 22 job categories, we found that LLMs will impact every category, ranging from 9% of a workday at the low end to 63% at the high end. In five of the 22 categories we examined, more than half of working hours can be transformed by LLMs. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/637201178) ^rw637201178
- What’s even more promising is that our analysis of 19,265 tasks found that more than half can use generative AI as an input to unleash creativity and enable novel solutions [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/637201273) ^rw637201273
