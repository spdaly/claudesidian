## Highlights
- “This supermarket mega-merger comes as American consumers have seen the cost of groceries rise steadily over the past few years,” Henry Liu, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, said in a news release. “Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons would lead to additional grocery price hikes for everyday goods. Essential grocery store workers would also suffer under this deal, facing the threat of their wages dwindling, benefits diminishing and working conditions deteriorating.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/689045433) ^rw689045433

- The FTC even cited Kroger’s and Albertsons’ own executives in making its argument. It quoted one executive, whom it didn’t identify, telling the agency: “You are basically creating a monopoly in grocery with the merger.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/689045435) ^rw689045435

- Kroger says the deal will actually help keep prices low, maintain jobs and strengthen competition. Its business model calls for it to take costs out of the business and invest in lowering prices. Kroger says it has invested $5 billion over the past 20 years to lower prices every year since 2003. And it committed to investing $500 million to start lowering prices on the first day the acquisition is complete. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/689045434) ^rw689045434

- Kroger also will invest $1.3 billion to improve Albertsons stores. And it’ll spend another $1 billion to increase wages and benefits. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/689045438) ^rw689045438

- The key thing to watch is the FTC’s efforts to seek a preliminary injunction halting the deal. If the judge approves that injunction, the deal is likely dead, said William Kovacic, a former FTC chair who was a member of the commission for five years and is now a professor of law at George Washington University. Some companies proceed and eventually go through the FTC’s process. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/689045026) ^rw689045026
- “Typically when a preliminary injunction is granted, the parties drop the merger,” Kovacic said. “Most companies would not wait that long.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/689045035) ^rw689045035
- “Our No. 1 competitor is Walmart. Our No. 2 competitor is Costco. Our biggest increasing competitor is Amazon,” he said on CNBC. “And then you have the discount stores, restaurants and everything else. The industry is constantly changing.”
  Walmart controls more than 25% of the national grocery market, based on figures from data analysis firm Numerator. Kroger has just 10.7%. A combined Kroger-Albertsons would have about 18%. Today, Albertsons ranks fourth with 7%. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/689045083) ^rw689045083
- But the FTC claims in its lawsuit more than 1,500 stores among the two companies would, when merged, create an increase in local market share that’s deemed illegal by antitrust standards. Further, the FTC said in the lawsuit even if non-supermarkets are included in the market analysis, “the proposed acquisition is still presumptively unlawful in most of the identified geographic markets.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/689045101) ^rw689045101
- “If you can make the case club stores (and e-commerce) are part of the market, then that clears the way for the merger,” he said. “If (Kroger and Albertsons) did raise prices, then all those competitors would eat their lunch. If I were the judge today, I’d say we should let the merger go through with some spinoffs to C&S.” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/689045440) ^rw689045440

- Montani places the odds of the deal going through at 55% to 60%. He figures Kroger and Albertsons will find middle ground to satisfy the FTC. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/689046153) ^rw689046153
