## Highlights
- But LLMs are not like that. They have been trained on more information than a human being can hope to even see in a lifetime. Assuming a human can read 300 words a min and 8 hours of reading time a day, they would read over a 30,000 to 50,000 books in their lifetime. Most people would manage perhaps a meagre subset of that, at best 1% of it. That’s at best 1 GB of data. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/698705580) ^rw698705580
- LLMs on the other hand, have imbibed everything on the internet and much else besides, hundreds of billions of words across all domains and disciplines. GPT-3 was trained on 45 terabytes of data. Doing the same math of 2MB per book that’s around 22.5 million books. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/698705592) ^rw698705592
- It’s a staggering quantity of data that they have learnt from. At this scale, even assuming they are only stochastic parrots, they should demonstrate incredible abilities. ‘Stochastic parrots’ isn’t a pejorative when the parrot can read and remember 22.5 million books! This breaks our brain for the same reason the dioramas of solar systems would break our brains if shown to scale - at sufficient scale, the world is incomprehensibly vast.
