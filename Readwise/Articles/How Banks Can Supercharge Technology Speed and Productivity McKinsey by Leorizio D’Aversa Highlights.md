## Highlights
- Financial institutions can unlock the productivity of their software engineering teams to significantly boost tech innovation without increasing IT budgets. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/809165001) ^rw809165001
- To boost tech innovation, a few leading banks have focused less on cutting costs and more on increasing the productivity of their engineering teams. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/809165520) ^rw809165520
- Taking a cue from digital-native software players, they are maximizing their portion of the technology workforce engaged in writing code, and then helping those engineers work as efficiently as possible. While this developer-first approach is common in the software industry, it’s not yet widespread among financial institutions. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/809165597) ^rw809165597
- best-performing banks can achieve fully 50 percent more technology capacity [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/809165608) ^rw809165608
- While they are clear on how much they spend and whether projects deliver on time, they have limited understanding of the productivity of their teams, or whether it would be worthwhile to invest in making them more efficient. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/809165635) ^rw809165635
- When companies quantify productivity, they pinpoint areas where engineering speed and accuracy can be improved, as well as identify meaningful ways to foster creativity [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/809165727) ^rw809165727
- To see how this works, let’s compare a hypothetical average bank with a leading bank. At the average bank, half of the technology employees create software, and those employees spend half of their time on the core activities of writing, testing, and maintaining code. In other words, only 25 percent of the average bank’s total technology capacity is devoted to writing software. The other 75 percent involves teams doing orchestration, analysis, and control processes that are important but could be better automated or streamlined. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/809165751) ^rw809165751
- Management teams start to ask what they can do to measurably improve productivity, evaluate the ROI of different actions they could take, and explore how to create a positive loop in which a better environment [attracts higher-caliber engineers](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/cracking-the-code-on-digital-talent). [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/809165763) ^rw809165763
- a developer writing software had to start by submitting requests to several other teams to get an environment set up. Once they finished coding, they then needed to do extensive manual testing, since the automated tests covered only a small portion of cases. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/809165805) ^rw809165805
- The company overhauled its engineering tools, automated its security controls, and created a coaching team to train frontline engineers in the new approach. Once the centralized tools were built, engineering teams adopted them in structured three-month waves over 12 months. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/809166701) ^rw809166701
- As the bank implemented this transformation, leaders also established a culture of continuous improvement. Similar to lean manufacturing operations, the bank’s technology teams began regularly reviewing their own productivity data and asking themselves what they could do to become faster and more productive. Ultimately, this organization created 30 percent more capacity in its existing technology team, without any increase in budget. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/809166723) ^rw809166723
- But while these gen AI tools are often successful in pilots, there are several challenges in scaling them safely and effectively. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/809166767) ^rw809166767
- underestimate the change management required [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/809166776) ^rw809166776
- strong adoption from the first 100 enthusiastic users but more limited uptake after that [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/809166779) ^rw809166779
- Second, many of the tools on the market are point solutions. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/809166799) ^rw809166799
- Third, many of the tools are not trained on a company’s code base, so they generate code that does not meet organizational standards. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/809166791) ^rw809166791
- They provide gen AI tools to everyone involved in the software development process, not just to coders. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/809166845) ^rw809166845
- roduct owners and managers, data analysts, user experience designers, and others get access to the gen AI tools they need to be more efficient. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/809166860) ^rw809166860
- product owners use gen AI tools that can automatically generate the stories and architecture diagrams for a new feature within seconds [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/809166882) ^rw809166882
- invest heavily in change management, recognizing that gen AI is a fundamental shift [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/809166902) ^rw809166902
- They fine-tune the gen AI tools on their own code base and use different large language models (LLMs) for different tasks. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/809166919) ^rw809166919
- new code generation but a different one that performs better for documentation. Institutions that deploy gen AI throughout the whole product life cycle can see a 20 to 30 percent uplift in development team productivity. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/809166971) ^rw809166971
