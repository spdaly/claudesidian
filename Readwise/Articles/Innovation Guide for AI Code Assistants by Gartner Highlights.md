## Highlights
- Early adopters of AI code assistants have reported results that range from overly optimistic to outright dismissive. This makes it difficult for software engineering leaders to understand and calculate the potential return on investment. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/738302017) ^rw738302017
- ode assistants, resorting to using unapproved versions to get their job done when they lack access to enterprise-approved versions. This behavior greatly increases the risk of enterprise code and data being used for training models. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/738302073) ^rw738302073
- More than 80% of developers are already using these tools to write code for personal projects, according to a May 2023 Stack Overflow survey.1 After a slow start, enterprises are accelerating their adoption of AI code assistants too. In our May 2023 survey, only 13% of IT leaders had implemented AI code assistants, with 36% currently investigating and 29% planning on investigating in 2024.2 In our more recent survey for 2024, the numbers jumped â€” with 17% having already deployed, 23% in the deployment stage, 20% piloting and 13% in the planning stage.3 [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/738602210) ^rw738602210
- The open-source community has also introduced a variety of code foundation models, such as Code Llama, Codestral and StarCoder. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/738602254) ^rw738602254
