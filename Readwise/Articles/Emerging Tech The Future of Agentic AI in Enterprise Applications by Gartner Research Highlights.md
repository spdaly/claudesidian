## Highlights
- While 70% of respondents say they have a centralized GenAI strategy, only 34% **apply it** **consistently across their enterprise applications**. However, organizations that do this exhibit higher confidence in their ability to govern AI, deliver effective change management, drive skills and assess its value. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/938764983) ^rw938764983
- Fewer than 5% of respondents fully trust their vendor’s hallucination safeguards, AI security, and governance controls. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/938765035) ^rw938765035
- Almost every major enterprise application that an organization is likely to own offers some form of in-built GenAI functionality, with many evolving these into no-code/low-code agent platforms that can integrate with other applications. Given the cost of these solutions, the security challenges, and the potential for duplication and overlap, application leaders must have a consistent and well-understood GenAI application strategy and know which vendors are likely to be their strategic partners for AI capabilities. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/938765117) ^rw938765117
- Many organizations currently favor a multivendor approach with a mix of buy and build for their AI solutions. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/938765155) ^rw938765155
- In addition to purchasing off-the-shelf AI tools, 44% of respondents said they built their own GenAI solutions for productivity (e.g., using services like OpenAI via Azure APIs). Most reported getting value from these tools, with 52% saying they provided significant value. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/938765202) ^rw938765202
- Survey respondents noted that the biggest pressure for the adoption of GenAI tools comes from executive leadership (65%) and business leadership (57%). However, only 16% strongly agreed that there is a commonly understood approach for measuring the impact and value of GenAI tools. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/938765236) ^rw938765236
- Application leaders feel under pressure to meet leadership expectations and deliver GenAI capabilities; however, due to the pace of change, 68% feel they are unable to keep up with the demand. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/938765249) ^rw938765249
- Most organizations (70%) say they have a central GenAI strategy, however, only 34% can apply it consistently to their enterprise applications. Worryingly, 29% still have no strategy and manage AI features on a case-by-case basis. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/938765258) ^rw938765258
- However, they are also the most **common challenges** that organizations cite when trying to scale their GenAI deployments. Indeed, security and governance concerns were identified by 70% of survey respondents among their top three challenges, followed by cost/lack of quantifiable ROI (57%), change management effort/difficulty integrating AI into work (41%), and lack of AI literacy and skills (40%). [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/938765319) ^rw938765319
- A further cross-cut of the data shows that organizations that can apply their GenAI strategy consistently are also far more likely to strongly agree that:
  • A strong partnership exists between IT and the business regarding GenAI adoption.
  • They have a commonly understood approach for measuring the value of GenAI tools.
  • There is an understanding between IT, business users and leadership about what problems GenAI can solve. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/938765581) ^rw938765581
- Only 14% of respondents are very confident that their content and data assets are suitably secured and governed to provide value for both AI and human interactions. Organizations continue to struggle with long-term information governance challenges, which has impacted GenAI’s effectiveness. Concerns around oversharing and misinformation with AI are still commonplace.
  One respondent put it clearly: *“There’s a lot of work to be done in securing our data.* *We work in a highly sensitive department**.”*
  Gartner defines AI-ready data as the ability to prove the fitness of data for AI use cases. To be AI-ready, the data must be aligned to the appropriate use case, must be subject to qualification to ensure continued fitness, and have appropriate data stewardship and governance controls.

- GenAI is unlike any software that application leaders have deployed before. There is no one way to use it that can be covered in a basic training session (like learning a GUI). It is nondeterministic technology that is almost entirely dependent on how the individual uses it, their role, their level of experience and where in the organization they work. As a result, the learning curve for employee adoption is often much higher than expected. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/938765952) ^rw938765952

- Most IT leaders (56%) strongly agree that IT cannot drive AI enablement on its own and must have support from the business. However, only 11% of respondents felt strongly that business departments were providing the required local training to help their staff effectively use GenAI tools. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/938765993) ^rw938765993
- Only 15% of respondents are considering truly autonomous agentic AI agents — agents that are goal-driven and require no human oversight. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/938766038) ^rw938766038 
- See also: [[agents]] 
- Most (61%) are looking at AI assistants plus automation, such as a large language model (LLM) that invokes a workflow to carry out a specific action. This suggests that while there is considerable hype and interest around agentic AI, most organizations are not deploying truly autonomous solutions.

- While the long-term implementation of AI agents is far less clear, most leaders do not think they will replace their applications or workers in the next two to four years. Only 12% strongly agree that AI agents will replace their applications in the next two to four years, while just 7% strongly agree they will replace their workers.
