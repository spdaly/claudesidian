- The market for GenAI services, which we forecast will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 169.7% between 2023 and 2027, demonstrates opportunities for services providers to create new sources of client value. Client enterprises are demanding that business and IT consulting firms help them understand the potential impact of generative models on their operations, products and services. In 2023, service providers including Deloitte, EY, PwC, Microsoft and Accenture were already working with clients on exploring GenAI use cases and developing proofs of value. They were also developing their own GenAI solutions and testing in their own environments. Thus, in 2023, spend on AI services was mostly substitutive to other projects that are now delayed (see [Forecast Analysis: Artificial Intelligence Services, 2023-2027, Worldwide](javascript:void(0);)).
