## Highlights
- Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/539322360) ^rw539322360
- GPT is a large language model (LLM) — also known as an AI foundation model — that uses deep learning to produce text that reads as if it were written by humans [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/539322378) ^rw539322378
- ChatGPT can generate new content, synthesize content and perform a variety of other tasks that create textual responses through a dialogue called a prompt. A prompt is a phrase or individual keywords used as input [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/539322388) ^rw539322388
- The training data used for the LLM determines how the questions will be answered. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/539322393) ^rw539322393
- AI foundation models such as GPT represent a huge step forward in the field of AI. Although general-purpose LLMs are very expensive and time-consuming to build, they make it faster and easier to create domain-specific models [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/539322438) ^rw539322438
- ChatGPT integrates three emerging AI technologies: LLM, chatbot (virtual assistant), and reinforcement learning with humans in the loop [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/539322456) ^rw539322456
- Each is the result of separate, significant improvements over the past five years. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/539322487) ^rw539322487
- Foundation models have been used for many purposes, including the generation of:
  • Textual content for marketing
  • Images from text
  • Computer code from natural language
  • New drug molecules and the deciphering of genome sequences in the field of healthcare
  • New materials with specific properties in the field of material science [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/539322529) ^rw539322529
- However, the way in which these models have been built means that LLMs — and products and services that use them — have well-recognized limitations in terms of stability, errors of reasoning and fact, ability to understand full context, explainability, tractability, bias and lack of adequate safeguards.
