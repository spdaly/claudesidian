## Highlights
- Most common AI application failures arise from insufficient or inaccurate context, not inherent model limitations. Without proper context, the application exhibits performance degradation, leading to unreliable outcomes and behaviors, or even task failures.

- Large context windows, while powerful, introduce critical failure modes, including context poisoning, distraction, confusion and clash. These issues compound as agent interactions extend, hindering effective reasoning and consistent output behaviors. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/938839699) ^rw938839699
- “...context engineering is the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information for the next step…” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/938839735) ^rw938839735
