## Highlights
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a NLP task that seeks to locate and classify entities mentioned in text into pre-defined categories (such as person names, organizations, locations, etc…). [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/736088444) ^rw736088444
- Defining categories of wikipedia as labels for NER tasks gives the possibility to define a NER system avoiding the data training problem. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/736089347) ^rw736089347
- **Topic Modeling**, we usually refer to a NLP tool that is able to discover the “hidden semantic structures” of a text body. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/736090017) ^rw736090017
- **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** is the popular topic modeling method that uses a probabilistic model to extract topics among *sets of documents*. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/736090464) ^rw736090464 
- See also: [[topic modeling]] [[natural language processing]] 
- **TextRank**, a method that uses network analysis to detect topics within a *single document*. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/736091284) ^rw736091284 
- See also: [[topic modeling]] 
- [**Semantic Hypergraphs**](https://graphbrain.net/overview/hypergraph.html)**,** a “novel technique combines the strengths of Machine Learning and symbolic approaches to infer topics from the meaning of sentences” [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/736091334) ^rw736091334
