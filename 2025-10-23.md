@ Meta Reality Labs

1000
- AI in ART (Annual Required Training)
- Focus on engineering optimization on OpEx/CapEx on RL hardware engineering
- Building early prototypes is a key objective
- How can we optimize the prototype process?
- How can do get more from the people/process/money expended?
- SmartSheet Device Schedule
	- Data needs to be ingested across many platforms
	- Gemini
	- How can we make SmartSheet and Gemini work together better?
	- Get the models to get to SmartSheet data to make better dashboards
	- How do we build trust in the SmartSheet data
		- Accuracy
		- Consistancy
	- Validated data pipelines
	- Enable engineering with schedule and usage data to support the product development pipelines
